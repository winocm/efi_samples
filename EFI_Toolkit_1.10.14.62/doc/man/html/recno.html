       recno - record number database access method


</PRE>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The  routine  <I>dbopen</I>  is the library interface to database
       files.  One of the supported file formats is record number
       files.	The  general  description  of the database access
       methods is in <B><A HREF="dbopen.html">dbopen(3)</A></B>, this manual page  describes  only
       the recno specific information.

       The  record  number  data  structure is either variable or
       fixed-length  records  stored  in  a   flat-file   format,
       accessed  by  the logical record number.  The existence of
       record number five implies the existence  of  records  one
       through four, and the deletion of record number one causes
       record number five to be renumbered to record number four,
       as  well  as the cursor, if positioned after record number
       one, to shift down one record.

       The recno access method specific data  structure  provided
       to  <I>dbopen</I>  is  defined in the &lt;db.h&gt; include file as fol-
       lows:

       typedef struct {
	      u_long flags;
	      u_int cachesize;
	      u_int psize;
	      int lorder;
	      size_t reclen;
	      u_char bval;
	      char *bfname;
       } RECNOINFO;

       The elements of this structure are defined as follows:

       flags  The flag value is specified by <I>or</I>'ing  any  of  the
	      following values:

	      R_FIXEDLEN
		     The   records  are  fixed-length,	not  byte
		     delimited.   The  structure  element  <I>reclen</I>
		     specifies	the length of the record, and the
		     structure element <I>bval</I> is used  as  the  pad
		     character.   Any  records, inserted into the
		     database, that are less  than  <I>reclen</I>  bytes
		     long are automatically padded.

	      R_NOKEY
		     In  the  interface  specified by <I>dbopen</I>, the
		     sequential record retrieval  fills  in  both

		     the  caller's  key  and data structures.  If
		     the R_NOKEY flag is  specified,  the  <I>cursor</I>
		     routines are not required to fill in the key
		     structure.   This	permits  applications  to
		     retrieve records at the end of files without
		     reading all of the intervening records.

	      R_SNAPSHOT
		     This flag requires that a	snapshot  of  the
		     file be taken when <I>dbopen</I> is called, instead
		     of permitting any unmodified records  to  be
		     read from the original file.

       cachesize
	      A  suggested  maximum size, in bytes, of the memory
	      cache.  This value is <B>only</B> advisory, and the access
	      method  will allocate more memory rather than fail.
	      If <I>cachesize</I> is  0 (no size is specified) a default
	      cache is used.

       psize  The recno access method stores the in-memory copies
	      of its records in a btree.  This value is the  size
	      (in  bytes)  of  the  pages  used for nodes in that
	      tree.  If <I>psize</I> is 0 (no page size is specified)	a
	      page  size  is  chosen based on the underlying file
	      system I/O  block  size.	 See  <B><A HREF="btree.html">btree(3)</A></B>	for  more
	      information.

       lorder The  byte order for integers in the stored database
	      metadata.  The number should represent the order as
	      an  integer; for example, big endian order would be
	      the number 4,321.  If <I>lorder</I>  is	0  (no	order  is
	      specified) the current host order is used.

       reclen The length of a fixed-length record.

       bval   The delimiting byte to be used to mark the end of a
	      record for variable-length  records,  and  the  pad
	      character for fixed-length records.  If no value is
	      specified, newlines (``\n'') are used to	mark  the
	      end  of  variable-length	records  and fixed-length
	      records are padded with spaces.

       bfname The recno access method stores the in-memory copies
	      of  its records in a btree.  If bfname is non-NULL,
	      it specifies the name of	the  btree  file,  as  if
	      specified  as the file name for a dbopen of a btree
	      file.

       The data part of the  key/data  pair  used  by  the  recno
       access  method  is  the same as other access methods.  The
       key is different.  The <I>data</I> field of the key should  be	a
       pointer	to  a memory location of type <I>recno</I><B>_</B><I>t</I>, as defined
       in the &lt;db.h&gt; include file.  This  type	is  normally  the

       largest	unsigned integral type available to the implemen-
       tation.	The <I>size</I> field of the key should be the  size  of
       that type.

       Because	there  can  be	no  meta-data associated with the
       underlying recno access method files, any changes made  to
       the default values (e.g. fixed record length or byte sepa-
       rator value) must be explicitly specified  each	time  the
       file is opened.

       In the interface specified by <I>dbopen</I>, using the <I>put</I> inter-
       face to create a new record will  cause	the  creation  of
       multiple,  empty records if the record number is more than
       one greater than  the  largest  record  currently  in  the
       database.

<H2>ERRORS</H2><PRE>
       The  <I>recno</I>  access  method routines may fail and set <I>errno</I>
       for any of the errors specified for  the  library  routine

       [EINVAL]
	      An  attempt  was	made  to add a record to a fixed-
	      length database that was too large to fit.
