<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <B>Read</B>() attempts to read <I>nbytes</I> of data from the object referenced by the
     descriptor <I>d</I> into the buffer pointed to by <I>buf</I>. <B>Readv</B>() performs the same
     action, but scatters the input data into the <I>iovcnt</I> buffers specified by
     the members of the <I>iov</I> array: iov[0], iov[1], ..., iov[iovcnt-1].
     <B>Pread</B>() performs the same function, but reads from the specified position
     in the file without modifying the file pointer.

     For <B>readv</B>(), the <I>iovec</I> structure is defined as:

	   struct iovec {
		   char   *iov_base;  /* Base address. */
		   size_t iov_len;    /* Length. */
	   };

     Each <I>iovec</I> entry specifies the base address and length of an area in mem-
     ory where data should be placed.  <B>Readv</B>() will always fill an area com-
     pletely before proceeding to the next.

     On objects capable of seeking, the <B>read</B>() starts at a position given by
     the pointer associated with <I>d</I> (see <B><A HREF="lseek.html">lseek(2)</A></B>).  Upon return from <B>read</B>(),
     the pointer is incremented by the number of bytes actually read.

     Objects that are not capable of seeking always read from the current po-
     sition.  The value of the pointer associated with such an object is unde-
     fined.

     Upon successful completion, <B>read</B>(), <B>readv</B>(), and <B>pread</B>() return the num-
     ber of bytes actually read and placed in the buffer.  The system guaran-
     tees to read the number of bytes requested if the descriptor references a
     normal file that has that many bytes left before the end-of-file, but in
     no other case.


</PRE>
<H2>IMPLEMENTATION NOTES</H2><PRE>
     In the non-threaded library <B>read</B>() is implemented as the <I>read</I> syscall.

     In the threaded library, the <I>read</I> syscall is assembled to
     <B>_thread_sys_read</B>() and <B>read</B>() is implemented as a function which locks <I>d</I>
     for read, then calls <B>_thread_sys_read</B>().  If the call to
     <B>_thread_sys_read</B>() would block, a context switch is performed. Before re-
     turning, <B>read</B>() unlocks <I>d</I>.

     In the non-threaded library <B>readv</B>() is implemented as the <I>readv</I> syscall.

     In the threaded library, the <I>readv</I> syscall is assembled to
     <B>_thread_sys_readv</B>() and <B>readv</B>() is implemented as a function which locks
     <I>d</I> for read, then calls <B>_thread_sys_readv</B>().  If the call to
     <B>_thread_sys_readv</B>() would block, a context switch is performed. Before
     returning, <B>readv</B>() unlocks <I>d</I>.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUES</H2><PRE>
     If successful, the number of bytes actually read is returned. Upon read-
     ing end-of-file, zero is returned.  Otherwise, a -1 is returned and the
     global variable <I>errno</I> is set to indicate the error.


</PRE>
<H2>ERRORS</H2><PRE>
     <B>Read</B>(), <B>readv</B>(), and <B>pread</B>() will succeed unless:

     [EBADF]	   <I>D</I> is not a valid file or socket descriptor open for read-
		   ing.

     [EFAULT]	   <I>Buf</I> points outside the allocated address space.

     [EIO]	   An I/O error occurred while reading from the file system.

     [EINTR]	   A read from a slow device was interrupted before any data
		   arrived by the delivery of a signal.

     [EINVAL]	   The pointer associated with <I>d</I> was negative.

     [EAGAIN]	   The file was marked for non-blocking I/O, and no data were
		   ready to be read.

     In addition, <B>readv</B>() may return one of the following errors:

     [EINVAL]	   <I>Iovcnt</I> was less than or equal to 0, or greater than 16.

     [EINVAL]	   One of the <I>iov</I><B>_</B><I>len</I> values in the <I>iov</I> array was negative.

     [EINVAL]	   The sum of the <I>iov</I><B>_</B><I>len</I> values in the <I>iov</I> array overflowed a
		   32-bit integer.

     [EFAULT]	   Part of the <I>iov</I> points outside the process's allocated ad-
		   dress space.

     The <B>pread</B>() call may also return the following errors:

     [EINVAL]	   The specified file offset is invalid.

     [ESPIPE]	   The file descriptor is associated with a pipe, socket, or
		   FIFO.

<H2>STANDARDS</H2><PRE>
     The <B>read</B>() function call is expected to conform to IEEE Std1003.1-1990
     (``POSIX''). The <B>readv</B>() and <B>pread</B>() functions are expected to conform to
     X/Open Portability Guide Issue 4.2 (``XPG4.2'').


</PRE>
<H2>HISTORY</H2><PRE>
     The <B>pread</B>() function call appeared in AT&amp;T System V.4 UNIX.  The <B>readv</B>()
     function call appeared in 4.2BSD. A <B>read</B>() function call appeared in Ver-
     sion 6 AT&amp;T UNIX.
