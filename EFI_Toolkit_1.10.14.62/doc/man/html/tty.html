</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     This section describes the interface to the terminal drivers in the sys-
     tem.

   <B>Terminal</B> <B>Special</B> <B>Files</B>
     Each hardware terminal port on the system usually has a terminal special
     device file (for example, ``tty00:, tty01:, etc.'').

     The remainder of this man page is concerned with describing details of
     using and controlling terminal devices at a low level, such as that
     possibly required by a program wishing to provide features similar to
     those provided by the system.

   <B>Line</B> <B>disciplines</B>
     A terminal file is used like any other file in the system in that it can
     be opened, read, and written to using standard system calls.  For each
     existing terminal file, there is a software processing module called a
     <I>line</I> <I>discipline</I> is associated with it.  The <I>line</I> <I>discipline</I> essentially
     glues the low level device driver code with the high level generic inter-
     face routines (such as <B><A HREF="read.html">read(2)</A></B> and <B><A HREF="write.html">write(2)</A></B>),  and is responsible for im-
     plementing the semantics associated with the device.  When a terminal
     file is first opened by a program, the default <I>line</I> <I>discipline</I> called the
     termios line discipline is associated with the file.  This is the primary
     line discipline that is used in most cases and provides the semantics
     that users normally associate with a terminal.  When the termios line
     discipline is in effect, the terminal file behaves and is operated ac-
     cording to the rules described in <B><A HREF="termios.html">termios(4)</A></B>.  Please refer to that man
     page for a full description of the terminal semantics.  The operations
     described here generally represent features common across all <I>line</I>
     <I>disciplines</I>, however some of these calls may not make sense in conjunc-
     tion with a line discipline other than termios, and some may not be sup-
     ported by the underlying hardware (or lack thereof, as in the case of
     ptys).

   <B>Terminal</B> <B>File</B> <B>Operations</B>
     All of the following operations are invoked using the <B><A HREF="ioctl.html">ioctl(2)</A></B> system
     call.  Refer to that man page for a description of the <I>request</I> and <I>argp</I>
     parameters.  In addition to the ioctl <I>requests</I> defined here, the specific
     line discipline in effect will define other <I>requests</I> specific to it (ac-
     tually <B><A HREF="termios.html">termios(4)</A></B> defines them as function calls, not ioctl <I>requests</I>.)
     The following section lists the available ioctl requests.	The name of
     the request, a description of its purpose, and the typed <I>argp</I> parameter
     (if any) are listed.  For example, the first entry says

	   <I>TIOCGETD</I> <I>int</I> <I>*ldisc</I>

     and would be called on the terminal associated with file descriptor zero
     by the following code fragment:

	     int ldisc;

	     ioctl(0, TIOCGETD, &amp;ldisc);

   <B>Terminal</B> <B>File</B> <B>Request</B> <B>Descriptions</B>

     TIOCGETD <I>int</I> <I>*ldisc</I>
		 Return the current line discipline in the integer pointed to
		 by <I>ldisc</I>.

     TIOCSDTR <I>void</I>
		 Assert data terminal ready (DTR).

     TIOCCDTR <I>void</I>
		 Clear data terminal ready (DTR).

     TIOCGETA <I>struct</I> <I>termios</I> <I>*term</I>
		 Place the current value of the termios state associated with
		 the device in the termios structure pointed to by <I>term</I>. This
		 is the underlying call that implements the <B><A HREF="termios.html">termios(4)</A></B>
		 <B>tcgetattr</B>() call.

     TIOCSETA <I>struct</I> <I>termios</I> <I>*term</I>
		 Set the termios state associated with the device immediately.
		 This is the underlying call that implements the <B><A HREF="termios.html">termios(4)</A></B>

		 <B>tcsetattr</B>() call with the TCSANOW option.

     TIOCSETAW <I>struct</I> <I>termios</I> <I>*term</I>
		 First wait for any output to complete, then set the termios
		 state associated with the device.  This is the underlying
		 call that implements the <B><A HREF="termios.html">termios(4)</A></B> <B>tcsetattr</B>() call with the
		 TCSADRAIN option.

     TIOCSETAF <I>struct</I> <I>termios</I> <I>*term</I>
		 First wait for any output to complete, clear any pending in-
		 put, then set the termios state associated with the device.
		 This is the underlying call that implements the <B><A HREF="termios.html">termios(4)</A></B>
		 <B>tcsetattr</B>() call with the TCSAFLUSH option.

     TIOCMODS <I>int</I> <I>*state</I>
     TIOCMSET <I>int</I> <I>*state</I>
		 The integer pointed to by <I>state</I> contains bits that correspond
		 to modem state.  Following is a list of defined variables and
		 the modem state they represent:

		 TIOCM_LE   Line Enable.
		 TIOCM_DTR  Data Terminal Ready.
		 TIOCM_RTS  Request To Send.
		 TIOCM_CTS  Clear To Send.
		 TIOCM_CAR  Carrier Detect.
		 TIOCM_CD   Carrier Detect (synonym).
		 TIOCM_RNG  Ring Indication.
		 TIOCM_RI   Ring Indication (synonym).
		 TIOCM_DSR  Data Set Ready.

		 This call sets the terminal modem state to that represented
		 by <I>state</I>. Not all terminals may support this.

     TIOCMODG <I>int</I> <I>*state</I>
     TIOCMGET <I>int</I> <I>*state</I>
		 Return the current state of the terminal modem lines as rep-
		 resented above in the integer pointed to by <I>state</I>.

     TIOCMBIS <I>int</I> <I>*state</I>
		 The bits in the integer pointed to by <I>state</I> represent modem
		 state as described above, however the state is OR-ed in with
		 the current state.

     TIOCMBIC <I>int</I> <I>*state</I>
		 The bits in the integer pointed to by <I>state</I> represent modem
		 state as described above, however each bit which is on in
		 <I>state</I> is cleared in the terminal.
