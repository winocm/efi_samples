<b>WFOPEN(3)</b>	       FreeBSD Library Functions Manual 	      <b>WFOPEN(3)</b>


</pre>

<h2>NAME</h2>

<pre>
     <b>wfopen</b> - wide character version of stream open function


</pre>

<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>

<pre>
     <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;wchar.h&gt;</b>

     <i>FILE</i> <i>*</i>
     <b>wfopen</b>(<i>const</i> <i>wchar_t</i> <i>*path</i>, <i>const</i> <i>wchar_t</i> <i>*mode</i>)


</pre>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<pre>
     The <b>wfopen</b>() function opens the file whose name is the wide character string
     pointed to by <i>path</i> and associates a stream with it.

     The argument <i>mode</i> points to a string beginning with one of the following
     sequences (Additional characters may follow these sequences.):

     L``r''   Open text file for reading.  The stream is positioned at the be-
	     ginning of the file.

     L``r+''  Open for reading and writing.  The stream is positioned at the
	     beginning of the file.

     L``w''   Truncate file to zero length or create text file for writing.
	     The stream is positioned at the beginning of the file.

     L``w+''  Open for reading and writing.  The file is created if it does not
	     exist, otherwise it is truncated.	The stream is positioned at
	     the beginning of the file.

     L``a''   Open for writing.	The file is created if it does not exist.  The
	     stream is positioned at the end of the file.

     L``a+''  Open for reading and writing.  The file is created if it does not
	     exist.  The stream is positioned at the end of the file.

     The <i>mode</i> string can also include the letter L``b'' either as a third char-
     acter or as a character between the characters in any of the two-charac-
     ter strings described above.  This is strictly for compatibility with ISO
     9899: 1990 (``ISO C'') and has no effect; the L``b'' is ignored.

     Any created files will have mode &quot;S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IWGRP |
     S_IROTH | S_IWOTH&quot; (0666), as modified by the process' umask value (see
     <b>umask(2)</b>).

     NULL is returned and the global variable <i>errno</i> is set to indicate the error.
