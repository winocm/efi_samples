<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     The <B>fopen</B>() function opens the file whose name is the string pointed to
     by <I>path</I> and associates a stream with it.

     The argument <I>mode</I> points to a string beginning with one of the following
     sequences (Additional characters may follow these sequences.):

     ``r''   Open text file for reading.  The stream is positioned at the be-
	     ginning of the file.

     ``r+''  Open for reading and writing.  The stream is positioned at the
	     beginning of the file.

     ``w''   Truncate file to zero length or create text file for writing.
	     The stream is positioned at the beginning of the file.

     ``w+''  Open for reading and writing.  The file is created if it does not
	     exist, otherwise it is truncated.	The stream is positioned at
	     the beginning of the file.

     ``a''   Open for writing.	The file is created if it does not exist.  The
	     stream is positioned at the end of the file.

     ``a+''  Open for reading and writing.  The file is created if it does not
	     exist.  The stream is positioned at the end of the file.

     The <I>mode</I> string can also include the letter ``b'' either as a third char-
     acter or as a character between the characters in any of the two-charac-
     ter strings described above.  This is strictly for compatibility with ISO
     9899: 1990 (``ISO C'') and has no effect; the ``b'' is ignored.

     Any created files will have mode "S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IWGRP |
     S_IROTH | S_IWOTH" (0666), as modified by the process' umask value (see
     <B><A HREF="umask.html">umask(2)</A></B>).

     Reads and writes may be intermixed on read/write streams in any order,
     and do not require an intermediate seek as in previous versions of <I>stdio</I>.
     This is not portable to other systems, however; ANSI C requires that a
     file positioning function intervene between output and input, unless an
     input operation encounters end-of-file.

     The <B>fdopen</B>() function associates a stream with the existing file descrip-
     tor, <I>fildes</I>. The <I>mode</I> of the stream must be compatible with the mode of
     the file descriptor.

     The <B>freopen</B>() function opens the file whose name is the string pointed to
     by <I>path</I> and associates the stream pointed to by <I>stream</I> with it.  The
     original stream (if it exists) is closed.	The <I>mode</I> argument is used just
     as in the <B>fopen</B>() function.  The primary use of the <B>freopen</B>() function is
     to change the file associated with a standard text stream (<I>stderr</I>, <I>stdin</I>,
     or <I>stdout</I>).


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUES</H2><PRE>
     Upon successful completion <B>fopen</B>(), <B>fdopen</B>() and <B>freopen</B>() return a FILE
     pointer.  Otherwise, NULL is returned and the global variable <I>errno</I> is
     set to indicate the error.


</PRE>
<H2>ERRORS</H2><PRE>
     [EINVAL]  The <I>mode</I> provided to <B>fopen</B>(), <B>fdopen</B>(), or <B>freopen</B>() was in-
	       valid.

     The <B>fopen</B>(), <B>fdopen</B>() and <B>freopen</B>() functions may also fail and set <I>errno</I>
     for any of the errors specified for the routine <B><A HREF="malloc.html">malloc(3)</A></B>.

     The <B>fopen</B>() function may also fail and set <I>errno</I> for any of the errors
     specified for the routine <B><A HREF="open.html">open(2)</A></B>.

     The <B>fdopen</B>() function may also fail and set <I>errno</I> for any of the errors
     specified for the routine <B><A HREF="fcntl.html">fcntl(2)</A></B>.

     The <B>freopen</B>() function may also fail and set <I>errno</I> for any of the errors
     specified for the routines <B><A HREF="open.html">open(2)</A></B>,  <B><A HREF="fclose.html">fclose(3)</A></B> and <B><A HREF="fflush.html">fflush(3)</A></B>.

<H2>STANDARDS</H2><PRE>
     The <B>fopen</B>() and <B>freopen</B>() functions conform to ISO 9899: 1990 (``ISO
     C''). The <B>fdopen</B>() function conforms to IEEE Std1003.1-1988 (``POSIX'').
