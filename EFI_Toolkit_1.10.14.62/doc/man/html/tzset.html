<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
     <B>tzset</B>, <B>tzsetwall</B> - initialize time conversion information


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     <B>#include</B> <B>&lt;time.h&gt;</B>

     <I>void</I>
     <B>tzset</B>(<I>void</I>)

     <I>void</I>
     <B>tzsetwall</B>(<I>void</I>)


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     The <B>tzset</B>() function initializes time conversion information used by the
     library routine <B><A HREF="ctime.html">localtime(3)</A></B>.  The environment variable TZ specifies how
     this is done.

     If TZ does not appear in the environment, the best available approxima-
     tion to local wall clock time, as specified by the <B><A HREF="tzfile.html">tzfile(5)</A></B>-format  file
     <I>/etc/localtime</I> is used.

     If TZ appears in the environment but its value is a null string, Coordi-
     nated Universal Time (UTC) is used (without leap second correction).

     If TZ appears in the environment and its value begins with a colon (`:'),
     the rest of its value is used as a pathname of a <B><A HREF="tzfile.html">tzfile(5)</A></B>-format	file
     from which to read the time conversion information.  If the first charac-
     ter of the pathname is a slash (`/') it is used as an absolute pathname;
     otherwise, it is used as a pathname relative to the system time conver-
     sion information directory.

     If its value does not begin with a colon, it is first used as the path-
     name of a file (as described above) from which to read the time conver-
     sion information.	If that file cannot be read, the value is then inter-
     preted as a direct specification (the format is described below) of the
     time conversion information.

     If the TZ environment variable does not specify a <B><A HREF="tzfile.html">tzfile(5)</A></B>-format  file
     and cannot be interpreted as a direct specification, UTC is used.

     The <B>tzsetwall</B>() function sets things up so that localtime returns the
     best available approximation of local wall clock time.


</PRE>
<H2>SPECIFICATION FORMAT</H2><PRE>
     When TZ is used directly as a specification of the time conversion infor-
     mation, it must have the following syntax (spaces inserted for clarity):

	   <I>std</I> <I>offset</I> [<I>dst</I> [<I>offset</I>] [ , <I>rule</I>]]

     Where:

	   <I>std</I> and <I>dst</I>	Three or more bytes that are the designation for the
			standard (<I>std</I>) or summer (<I>dst</I>) time zone.  Only <I>std</I> is
			required; if <I>dst</I> is missing, then summer time does not
			apply in this locale.  Upper and lowercase letters are
			explicitly allowed.  Any characters except a leading
			colon (`:'), digits, comma (`,'), minus (`-'), plus
			(`+'), and ASCII NUL are allowed.

	   <I>offset</I>	Indicates the value one must add to the local time to
			arrive at Coordinated Universal Time.  The <I>offset</I> has
			the form:

			      <I>hh</I> [:<I>mm</I>[ : <I>ss</I>]]

			The minutes (<I>mm</I>) and seconds (<I>ss</I>) are optional.  The
			hour (<I>hh</I>) is required and may be a single digit.  The
			<I>offset</I> following <I>std</I> is required.  If no <I>offset</I> fol-
			lows <I>dst</I>, summer time is assumed to be one hour ahead
			of standard time.  One or more digits may be used; the
			value is always interpreted as a decimal number.  The
			hour must be between zero and 24, and the minutes (and
			seconds) -- if present -- between zero and 59.	If
			preceded by a (`-') the time zone shall be east of the
			Prime Meridian; otherwise it shall be west (which may
			be indicated by an optional preceding (`+')).

	   <I>rule</I> 	Indicates when to change to and back from summer time.
			The <I>rule</I> has the form:

			      <I>date/time,date/time</I>

			where the first <I>date</I> describes when the change from
			standard to summer time occurs and the second <I>date</I> de-
			scribes when the change back happens.  Each <I>time</I> field
			describes when, in current local time, the change to
			the other time is made.

			The format of <I>date</I> is one of the following:

			<B>J</B> <I>n</I>	 The Julian day <I>n</I> (1 &lt;= <I>n</I> &lt;= 365).  Leap days
				 are not counted; that is, in all years -- in-
				 cluding leap years -- February 28 is day 59
				 and March 1 is day 60.  It is impossible to
				 explicitly refer to the occasional February
				 29.

			<I>n</I>	 The zero-based Julian day (0 &lt;= <I>n</I> &lt;= 365 ) .
				 Leap days are counted, and it is possible to
				 refer to February 29.

			<B>M</B> <I>m.n.d</I>  The <I>d</I>'th day (0 &lt;= <I>d</I> &lt;= 6 ) of week <I>n</I> of
				 month <I>m</I> of the year (1 &lt;= <I>n</I> &lt;= 5), (1 &lt;= <I>m</I> &lt;=
				 12), where week 5 means ``the last <I>d</I> day in
				 month <I>m</I>'' which may occur in either the
				 fourth or the fifth week).  Week 1 is the
				 first week in which the <I>d</I>'th day occurs.  Day
				 zero is Sunday.

				 The <I>time</I> has the same format as <I>offset</I> except
				 that no leading sign (`-') or (`+') is al-
				 lowed.  The default, if <I>time</I> is not given, is
				 <B>02:00:00</B>.

			If no <I>rule</I> is present in the TZ specification, the
			rules specified by the <B><A HREF="tzfile.html">tzfile(5)</A></B>-format  file
			<I>posixrules</I> in the system time conversion information
			directory are used, with the standard and summer time
			offsets from UTC replaced by those specified by the
			<I>offset</I> values in TZ.

     For compatibility with System V Release 3.1, a semicolon (`;') may be
     used to separate the <I>rule</I> from the rest of the specification.

<H2>FILES</H2><PRE>
     /etc/localtime		     local time zone file

     /usr/share/zoneinfo	     time zone directory
     /usr/share/zoneinfo/posixrules  rules for POSIX-style TZ's
     /usr/share/zoneinfo/GMT  for    UTC leap seconds

     If the file <I>/usr/share/zoneinfo/GMT</I> does not exist, UTC leap seconds are
     loaded from <I>/usr/share/zoneinfo/posixrules</I>.
