<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       dhclient-script -  DHCP client network configuration script


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The DHCP client network configuration  script  is  invoked
       when the dhclient(8) protocol is loaded.  This  script  is
       used by the  dhcp client to set each  interface's  initial
       configuration prior  to requesting an address, to test the
       address once it has been offered, and to set the interface's
       final configuration once a lease has been acquired.

       This script is not meant to be customized by the end user.
       If  local customizations are needed, they should be possi-
       ble using the enter and exit hooks provided (see HOOKS for
       details).    These  hooks  will allow the user to override
       the  default  behaviour  of  the  client  in  creating   a
       /etc/resolv.conf file.
