<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       These  functions constitute the C math library, <I>libm.</I>  The
       link editor searches this library under the "-lm"  option.
       Declarations  for these functions may be obtained from the
       include file &lt;<I>math.h</I>&gt;.

<H2>LIST OF FUNCTIONS</H2><PRE>
       Each of the following double functions has a  float  coun-
       terpart with the name ending in f, as an example the float
       counterpart of double acos(double x) is float  acosf(float
       x).

<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       In  4.3 BSD, distributed from the University of California
       in late 1985, most of the foregoing functions come in  two
       versions,  one  for the double-precision "D" format in the
       DEC VAX-11 family of computers, another for  double-preci-
       sion  arithmetic  conforming  to the IEEE Standard 754 for
       Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic.  The two versions behave
       very  similarly,  as should be expected from programs more
       accurate and robust than was the norm when UNIX was  born.
       For instance, the programs are accurate to within the num-
       bers of <I>ulp</I>s tabulated above; an <I>ulp</I> is one  <I>U</I>nit  in  the
       <I>L</I>ast <I>P</I>lace.  And the programs have been cured of anomalies
       that afflicted the older math library <I>libm</I> in which  inci-
       dents like the following had been reported:
	      sqrt(-1.0) = 0.0 and log(-1.0) = -1.7e38.
	      cos(1.0e-11) &gt; cos(0.0) &gt; 1.0.
	      pow(x,1.0) != x when x = 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, ..., 9.0.
	      pow(-1.0,1.0e10) trapped on Integer Overflow.
	      sqrt(1.0e30) and sqrt(1.0e-30) were very slow.
       However the two versions do differ in ways that have to be
       explained, to which end the following notes are	provided.

       <B>DEC</B> <B>VAX-11</B> <B>D_floating-point:</B>

       This  is  the  format  for which the original math library
       <I>libm</I> was developed, and to  which  this	manual	is  still
       principally  dedicated.	It is <I>the</I> double-precision format
       for the PDP-11 and the earlier  VAX-11  machines;  VAX-11s
       after  1983  were  provided  with  an  optional "G" format
       closer to the IEEE double-precision format.   The  earlier
       DEC  MicroVAXs  have no D format, only G double-precision.
       (Why?  Why not?)

       Properties of D_floating-point:
	      Wordsize: 64 bits, 8 bytes.  Radix: Binary.
	      Precision: 56 sig.   bits,  roughly  like  17  sig.
	      decimals.
		     If   x   and  x'  are  consecutive  positive
		     D_floating-point numbers (they differ  by	1
		     <I>ulp</I>), then
		     1.3e-17  &lt;  0.5**56  &lt; (x'-x)/x &lt;= 0.5**55 &lt;
		     2.8e-17.
	      Range: Overflow threshold  = 2.0**127 = 1.7e38.
		     Underflow threshold = 0.5**128 = 2.9e-39.
		     NOTE:  THIS RANGE IS COMPARATIVELY NARROW.
		     Overflow customarily stops computation.
		     Underflow is customarily flushed quietly  to
		     zero.
		     CAUTION:
			     It  is  possible  to have x != y and

			   May 6, 1991				2

<B><A HREF="MATH.html">MATH(3M)</A></B>						 <B><A HREF="MATH.html">MATH(3M)</A></B>

			     yet x-y = 0  because  of  underflow.
			     Similarly	x  &gt; y &gt; 0 cannot prevent
			     either x*y = 0 or	y/x = 0 from hap-
			     pening without warning.
	      Zero is represented ambiguously.
		     Although  2**55 different representations of
		     zero are accepted by the hardware, only  the
		     obvious  representation  is  ever	produced.
		     There is no -0 on a VAX.
	      Infinity is not part of the VAX architecture.
	      Reserved operands:
		     of the 2**55 that the  hardware  recognizes,
		     only  one	of  them  is  ever produced.  Any
		     floating-point  operation	upon  a  reserved
		     operand,  even  a	MOVF or MOVD, customarily
		     stops computation,  so  they  are	not  much
		     used.
	      Exceptions:
		     Divisions	by zero and operations that over-
		     flow are invalid operations that customarily
		     stop  computation	or,  in earlier machines,
		     produce reserved  operands  that  will  stop
		     computation.
	      Rounding:
		     Every  rational operation	(+, -, *, /) on a
		     VAX (but not necessarily on  a  PDP-11),  if
		     not  an over/underflow nor division by zero,
		     is rounded to within half an <I>ulp</I>,	and  when
		     the  rounding  error  is exactly half an <I>ulp</I>
		     then rounding is away from 0.

       Except for its narrow range, D_floating-point  is  one  of
       the  better  computer  arithmetics designed in the 1960's.
       Its properties are reflected fairly faithfully in the ele-
       mentary	functions for a VAX distributed in 4.3 BSD.  They
       over/underflow only if their results have to  lie  out  of
       range  or very nearly so, and then they behave much as any
       rational arithmetic operation that over/underflowed  would
       behave.	 Similarly,  expressions like <B><A HREF="log.html">log(0)</A></B> and <B><A HREF="atanh.html">atanh(1)</A></B>
       behave like 1/0; and sqrt(-3) and <B><A HREF="acos.html">acos(3)</A></B> behave like 0/0;
       they  all  produce  reserved operands and/or stop computa-
       tion!  The situation is described in more detail in manual
       pages.

       How do the functions in 4.3 BSD's new <I>libm</I> for  UNIX  com-
       pare  with  their  counterparts	in DEC's VAX/VMS library?
       Some of the VMS functions are a little faster, some are	a
       little  more  accurate,	some  are  more puritanical about

       exceptions (like  pow(0.0,0.0)  and  atan2(0.0,0.0)),  and
       most  occupy  much  more memory than their counterparts in
       <I>libm</I>.  The VMS codes interpolate in large table to achieve
       speed  and  accuracy;  the  <I>libm</I> codes use tricky formulas
       compact enough that all of them may some day  fit  into	a
       ROM.

       More  important,  DEC regards the VMS codes as proprietary
       and guards them zealously against unauthorized  use.   But
       the  <I>libm</I>  codes  in  4.3  BSD are intended for the public
       domain; they may be copied freely  provided  their  prove-
       nance  is  always  acknowledged, and provided users assist
       the authors in their researches	by  reporting  experience
       with  the  codes.   Therefore no user of UNIX on a machine
       whose arithmetic resembles VAX D_floating-point	need  use
       anything worse than the new <I>libm</I>.

       <B>IEEE</B> <B>STANDARD</B> <B>754</B> <B>Floating-Point</B> <B>Arithmetic:</B>

       This  standard  is  on  its  way  to  becoming more widely
       adopted than any other  design  for  computer  arithmetic.
       VLSI  chips  that conform to some version of that standard
       have been produced by a host of manufacturers, among  them
       ...
	    Intel i8087, i80287      National Semiconductor  32081
	    Motorola 68881	     Weitek WTL-1032, ... , -1165
	    Zilog Z8070 	     Western Electric (AT&amp;T) WE32106.
       Other implementations range from software, done thoroughly
       in   the   Apple   Macintosh,   through	 VLSI	in    the
       Hewlett-Packard 9000 series, to the ELXSI 6400 running ECL
       at 3 Megaflops.	Several other companies have adopted  the
       formats	of  IEEE 754 without, alas, adhering to the stan-
       dard's  way  of	handling  rounding  and  exceptions  like
       over/underflow.	 The  DEC  VAX G_floating-point format is
       very similar to the IEEE 754  Double  format,  so  similar
       that  the  C programs for the IEEE versions of most of the
       elementary functions listed above  could  easily  be  con-
       verted to run on a MicroVAX, though nobody has volunteered
       to do that yet.

       The codes in 4.3 BSD's <I>libm</I> for machines that  conform  to
       IEEE  754  are  intended  primarily for the National Semi.
       32081 and WTL 1164/65.  To use these codes with the  Intel
       or Zilog chips, or with the Apple Macintosh or ELXSI 6400,
       is to forego the use of	better	codes  provided  (perhaps
       freely)	by  those  companies  and designed by some of the
       authors of the codes above.  Except for <I>atan</I>, <I>cabs</I>,  <I>cbrt</I>,
       <I>erf</I>,  <I>erfc</I>,  <I>hypot</I>,  <I>j0-jn</I>,  <I>lgamma</I>,  <I>pow</I>  and  <I>y0-yn</I>, the
       Motorola 68881 has all the functions in <I>libm</I> on chip,  and
       faster  and more accurate; it, Apple, the i8087, Z8070 and
       WE32106 all use 64 sig.	bits.  The  main  virtue  of  4.3
       BSD's  <I>libm</I> codes is that they are intended for the public
       domain; they may be copied freely  provided  their  prove-
       nance  is  always  acknowledged, and provided users assist

       the authors in their researches	by  reporting  experience
       with  the  codes.   Therefore no user of UNIX on a machine
       that conforms to IEEE 754 need use anything worse than the
       new <I>libm</I>.

       Properties of IEEE 754 Double-Precision:
	      Wordsize: 64 bits, 8 bytes.  Radix: Binary.
	      Precision:  53  sig.   bits,  roughly  like 16 sig.
	      decimals.
		     If x and x' are  consecutive  positive  Dou-
		     ble-Precision  numbers  (they  differ  by	1
		     <I>ulp</I>), then
		     1.1e-16 &lt; 0.5**53 &lt; (x'-x)/x  &lt;=  0.5**52	&lt;
		     2.3e-16.
	      Range: Overflow threshold  = 2.0**1024 = 1.8e308
		     Underflow threshold = 0.5**1022 = 2.2e-308
		     Overflow  goes by default to a signed Infin-
		     ity.
		     Underflow is <I>Gradual,</I> rounding to the  near-
		     est   integer   multiple	of   0.5**1074	=
		     4.9e-324.
	      Zero is represented ambiguously as +0 or -0.
		     Its sign transforms correctly through multi-
		     plication	or  division, and is preserved by
		     addition of zeros with like signs;  but  x-x
		     yields  +0  for  every  finite  x.  The only
		     operations that reveal zero's sign are divi-
		     sion  by  zero and copysign(x,+-0).  In par-
		     ticular, comparison (x &gt; y, x  &gt;=	y,  etc.)
		     cannot  be affected by the sign of zero; but
		     if finite x = y then Infinity =  1/(x-y)  !=
		     -1/(y-x) = -Infinity.
	      Infinity is signed.
		     it  persists  when added to itself or to any
		     finite number.   Its  sign  transforms  cor-
		     rectly  through multiplication and division,
		     and (finite)/+-Infinity = +-0 (nonzero)/0	=
		     +-Infinity.   But	Infinity-Infinity, Infin-
		     ity*0 and Infinity/Infinity  are,	like  0/0
		     and  sqrt(-3),  invalid operations that pro-
		     duce <I>NaN</I>. ...
	      Reserved operands:
		     there are 2**53-2 of them,  all  called  <I>NaN</I>
		     (<I>N</I>ot  <I>a</I>  <I>N</I>umber).	 Some,	called	Signaling
		     <I>NaN</I>s, trap any floating-point operation per-
		     formed  upon  them;  they	are  used to mark
		     missing or uninitialized values, or nonexis-
		     tent elements of arrays.  The rest are Quiet
		     <I>NaN</I>s;  they  are  the  default  results   of
		     Invalid  Operations,  and	propagate through
		     subsequent arithmetic operations.	If x != x
		     then x is <I>NaN</I>; every other predicate (x &gt; y,
		     x = y, x &lt;  y,  ...)  is  FALSE  if  <I>NaN</I>  is
		     involved.

			   May 6, 1991				5

<B><A HREF="MATH.html">MATH(3M)</A></B>						 <B><A HREF="MATH.html">MATH(3M)</A></B>

		     NOTE: Trichotomy is violated by <I>NaN</I>.
			     Besides being FALSE, predicates that
			     entail  ordered  comparison,  rather
			     than   mere   (in)equality,   signal
			     Invalid  Operation   when	 <I>NaN</I>   is
			     involved.
	      Rounding:
		     Every algebraic operation (+, -, *, /, sqrt)
		     is rounded by default to within half an <I>ulp</I>,
		     and  when the rounding error is exactly half
		     an <I>ulp</I> then the rounded value's  least  sig-
		     nificant bit is zero.  This kind of rounding
		     is usually the best kind, sometimes provably
		     so;  for  instance,  for every x = 1.0, 2.0,
		     3.0, 4.0, ..., 2.0**52, we find  (x/3.0)*3.0
		     == x and (x/10.0)*10.0 == x and ...  despite
		     that both the  quotients  and  the  products
		     have  been rounded.  Only rounding like IEEE
		     754 can do that.	But  no  single  kind  of
		     rounding  can  be proved best for every cir-
		     cumstance, so  IEEE  754  provides  rounding
		     towards zero or towards +Infinity or towards
		     -Infinity at the programmer's  option.   And
		     the same kinds of rounding are specified for
		     Binary-Decimal  Conversions,  at  least  for
		     magnitudes   between   roughly  1.0e-10  and
		     1.0e37.
	      Exceptions:
		     IEEE 754 recognizes  five	kinds  of  float-
		     ing-point	 exceptions,   listed	below  in
		     declining order of probable importance.
			     Exception		    Default Result
			     __________________________________________
			     Invalid Operation	    <I>NaN</I>, or FALSE
			     Overflow		    +-Infinity
			     Divide by Zero	    +-Infinity
			     Underflow		    Gradual Underflow
			     Inexact		    Rounded value
		     NOTE:  An Exception is not an  Error  unless
		     handled badly.  What makes a class of excep-
		     tions exceptional is that no single  default
		     response	can   be  satisfactory	in  every
		     instance.	On the other hand, if  a  default
		     response will serve most instances satisfac-
		     torily, the unsatisfactory instances  cannot
		     justify  aborting computation every time the
		     exception occurs.

	      For each kind of floating-point exception, IEEE 754
	      provides a Flag that is raised each time its excep-
	      tion is signaled, and stays raised until	the  pro-
	      gram  resets  it.  Programs may also test, save and
	      restore a flag.  Thus, IEEE 754 provides three ways
	      by  which  programs  may	cope  with exceptions for

			   May 6, 1991				6

<B><A HREF="MATH.html">MATH(3M)</A></B>						 <B><A HREF="MATH.html">MATH(3M)</A></B>

	      which the default result might be unsatisfactory:

	      1)  Test for a condition that might cause an excep-
		  tion	later, and branch to avoid the exception.

	      2)  Test a flag to see  whether  an  exception  has
		  occurred since the program last reset its flag.

	      3)  Test a result to see whether it is a value that
		  only an exception could have produced.
		  CAUTION:  The  only  reliable  ways to discover
		  whether Underflow  has  occurred  are  to  test
		  whether  products  or  quotients  lie closer to
		  zero than the underflow threshold, or  to  test
		  the Underflow flag.  (Sums and differences can-
		  not underflow in IEEE 754; if x != y	then  x-y
		  is  correct  to  full  precision  and certainly
		  nonzero regardless of  how  tiny  it	may  be.)
		  Products and quotients that underflow gradually
		  can lose accuracy gradually without  vanishing,
		  so  comparing them with zero (as one might on a
		  VAX) will not reveal the loss.  Fortunately, if
		  a gradually underflowed value is destined to be
		  added to something bigger  than  the	underflow
		  threshold, as is almost always the case, digits
		  lost to gradual underflow will  not  be  missed
		  because  they  would have been rounded off any-
		  way.	So gradual underflows are  usually  <I>prov-</I>
		  <I>ably</I>	ignorable.   The  same	cannot be said of
		  underflows flushed to 0.

	      At the option of an implementor conforming to  IEEE
	      754, other ways to cope with exceptions may be pro-
	      vided:

	      4)  ABORT.  This mechanism classifies an	exception
		  in  advance  as  an  incident  to be handled by
		  means traditionally associated with  error-han-
		  dling  statements  like  "ON	ERROR GO TO ...".
		  Different languages offer  different	forms  of
		  this	statement,  but  most share the following
		  characteristics:

	      --  No means is provided to substitute a value  for
		  the  offending  operation's  result  and resume
		  computation from what may be the middle  of  an
		  expression.	An  exceptional  result  is aban-
		  doned.

	      --  In a subprogram that	lacks  an  error-handling
		  statement,  an  exception causes the subprogram
		  to abort within whatever program called it, and
		  so  on back up the chain of calling subprograms
		  until   an	error-handling	  statement    is

		  encountered  or  the	whole task is aborted and
		  memory is dumped.

	      5)  STOP.  This mechanism, requiring an interactive
		  debugging environment, is more for the program-
		  mer than the program.  It classifies an  excep-
		  tion	in advance as a symptom of a programmer's
		  error; the exception suspends execution as near
		  as  it  can  to the offending operation so that
		  the programmer can look around to  see  how  it
		  happened.  Quite often the first several excep-
		  tions turn out to be quite unexceptionable,  so
		  the  programmer  ought  ideally  to  be able to
		  resume execution after each one as if execution
		  had not been stopped.

	      6)  ...  Other  ways  lie  beyond the scope of this
		  document.

       The crucial problem for exception handling is the  problem
       of  Scope,  and	the problem's solution is understood, but
       not enough manpower was available to implement it fully in
       time  to  be distributed in 4.3 BSD's <I>libm</I>.  Ideally, each
       elementary function should act as if it were  indivisible,
       or atomic, in the sense that ...

       i)    No exception should be signaled that is not deserved
	     by the data supplied to that function.

       ii)   Any exception signaled  should  be  identified  with
	     that  function  rather  than with one of its subrou-
	     tines.

       iii)  The internal behavior of an atomic  function  should
	     not be disrupted when a calling program changes from
	     one to another of the five or so  ways  of  handling
	     exceptions  listed above, although the definition of
	     the function may be  correlated  intentionally  with
	     exception handling.

       Ideally,  every	programmer should be able <I>conveniently</I> to
       turn a debugged subprogram into one that appears atomic to
       its users.  But simulating all three characteristics of an
       atomic function is still a tedious affair, entailing hosts
       of  tests and saves-restores; work is under way to amelio-
       rate the inconvenience.

       Meanwhile, the functions in <I>libm</I>  are  only  approximately
       atomic.	 They  signal  no  inappropriate exception except
       possibly ...
	      Over/Underflow
		     when a result, if properly  computed,  might
		     have lain barely within range, and
	      Inexact in <I>cabs</I>, <I>cbrt</I>, <I>hypot</I>, <I>log10</I> and <I>pow</I>

		     when  it happens to be exact, thanks to for-
		     tuitous cancellation of errors.
       Otherwise, ...
	      Invalid Operation is signaled only when
		     any result but <I>NaN</I> would  probably  be  mis-
		     leading.
	      Overflow is signaled only when
		     the  exact result would be finite but beyond
		     the overflow threshold.
	      Divide-by-Zero is signaled only when
		     a function takes exactly infinite values  at
		     finite operands.
	      Underflow is signaled only when
		     the exact result would be nonzero but tinier
		     than the underflow threshold.
	      Inexact is signaled only when
		     greater range or precision would  be  needed
		     to represent the exact result.

<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       When  signals are appropriate, they are emitted by certain
       operations within the codes, so a subroutine-trace may  be
       needed  to  identify  the function with its signal in case
       method 5) above is in use.  And the  codes  all	take  the
       IEEE  754 defaults for granted; this means that a decision
       to trap all divisions by zero could disrupt  a  code  that
       would  otherwise  get  correct results despite division by
       zero.

<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       An explanation of IEEE 754 and its proposed extension p854
       was  published  in  the IEEE magazine MICRO in August 1984
       under the title "A Proposed Radix-  and	Word-length-inde-
       pendent	Standard  for Floating-point Arithmetic" by W. J.
       Cody et al.  The manuals for Pascal, C and  BASIC  on  the
       Apple  Macintosh  document the features of IEEE 754 pretty
       well.  Articles in the IEEE magazine COMPUTER vol. 14  no.
       3  (Mar.   1981), and in the ACM SIGNUM Newsletter Special
       Issue of Oct. 1979, may be helpful although  they  pertain
       to superseded drafts of the standard.
