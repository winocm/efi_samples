<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
        <B>ftpctrl</B> [-s] || [-n nice factor] [-t connect timeout]

        -s      Stops and unloads the running FTP server.
        -n xxx  Sets nice factor (0 - 2) for the running FTP server.
                The nice factor controls how 'nice' the FTP server is to other
                processes such as the EFI shell, during file transfers.
                0 = Slowest file transfers - nicest for simultaneous EFI shell use.
                1 = Faster file transfers* - EFI shell may run visually slower.
                2 = Fastest file transfers - EFI shell not useable during transfers.
                    * default
        -t xxx  Sets inactivity timeout for the running FTP server
                to xxx seconds. Legal values are (120 - 86400 seconds).
                The default inactivity timeout is 7200 seconds.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
        <B>ftpctrl</B> is an EFI shell application used to control a running EFI FTP
        server <B><A HREF="ftpd.html">ftpd</B></A>.  It can be used to stop a running FTP server, query current
        status, or view/adjust runtime settings. If <B>ftpctrl</B> is invoked with no
        command line switches, the current FTP server status is displayed.

        The <B>-s</B> switch will immediately stop and unload a running FTP server.
        If there is an existing client connection or file transfer in progress,
        the connection will be closed and the transfer aborted.

        The <B>-n</B> switch provides the means to adjust how much CPU time the FTP
        server will use while transferring files.  This affects &quot;foreground&quot;
        programs such as the EFI shell and anything being executed from the shell.
        The lowest nice factor will cause the FTP server to back off more often,
        thus allowing the foreground more CPU time.  The highest nice factor will
        cause the FTP server to use as much CPU as it can to transfer files at the
        expense of foreground programs.

        The <B>-t</B> switch sets the FTP server's inactivity timeout.  If a client is
        connected, the timer will cause the FTP server to disconnect if no commands
        are received within the timeout period.  The timer is also used during file
        transfers.  The FTP server will disconnect the client if no data is
        transferred within the timeout period.
