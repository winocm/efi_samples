<B>WGETOPT(1)</B>		FreeBSD General Commands Manual 	     <B>WGETOPT(1)</B>


</PRE>
<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
     <B>wgetopt</B> - parse wide command options


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     <B>args=`wgetopt</B> <I>optstring</I> <I>$*`</I> ; errcode=$?; set -- $args


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <B>Wgetopt</B> is used to break up options in command lines for easy parsing by
     shell procedures, and to check for legal options.	<I>Optstring</I> is a string
     of recognized option letters (see <B>wgetopt(3)</B> ); if a letter is followed by
     a colon, the option is expected to have an argument which may or may not
     be separated from it by white space.  The special option `--' is used to
     delimit the end of the options.  <B>Wgetopt</B> will place `--' in the arguments
     at the end of the options, or recognize it if used explicitly.  The shell
     arguments (<B>$1</B> <B>$2</B> ...) are reset so that each option is preceded by a `-'
     and in its own shell argument; each option argument is also in its own
     shell argument.


</PRE>
<H2>EXAMPLE</H2><PRE>
     The following code fragment shows how one might process the arguments for
     a command that can take the options <B>-a</B> and <B>-b</B>, and the option <B>-o</B>, which
     requires an argument.

	   args=`wgetopt abo: $*`
	   # you should not use `wgetopt abo: "$@"` since that would parse
	   # the arguments differently from what the set command below does.
	   if [ $? != 0 ]
	   then
		   echo 'Usage: ...'
		   exit 2
	   fi
	   set -- $args
	   # You cannot use the set command with a backquoted wgetopt directly,
	   # since the exit code from wgetopt would be shadowed by those of set,
	   # which is zero by definition.
	   for i
	   do
		   case "$i"
		   in
			   -a|-b)
				   echo flag $i set; sflags="${i#-}$sflags";
				   shift;;
			   -o)
				   echo oarg is "'"$2"'"; oarg="$2"; shift;
				   shift;;
			   --)
				   shift; break;;
		   esac
	   done
	   cmd -oarg -a file file
	   cmd -a -oarg -- file file

<H2>DIAGNOSTICS</H2><PRE>
     <B>Wgetopt</B> prints an error message on the standard error output and exits
     with status &gt; 0 when it encounters an option letter not included in
     <I>optstring</I>.


</PRE>
<H2>HISTORY</H2><PRE>
     Written by Henry Spencer, working from a Bell Labs manual page.  Behavior
     believed identical to the Bell version. Example changed in FreeBSD ver-
     sion 3.2 and 4.0.

<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
     Whatever <B>wgetopt(3)</B> has.

     Arguments containing white space or embedded shell metacharacters gener-
     ally will not survive intact;  this looks easy to fix but isn't. People
     trying to fix <B>wgetopt</B> or the example in this manpage should check the his-
     tory of this file in FreeBSD.

     The error message for an invalid option is identified as coming from
     <B>wgetopt</B> rather than from the shell procedure containing the invocation of
     <B>wgetopt</B>; this again is hard to fix.

     The precise best way to use the <B>set</B> command to set the arguments without
     disrupting the value(s) of shell options varies from one shell version to
     another.

     Each shellscript has to carry complex code to parse arguments halfway
     correcty (like the example presented here). A better wgetopt-like tool
     would move much of the complexity into the tool and keep the client shell
     scripts simpler.
