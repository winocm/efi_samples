<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
     <B>_exit</B> - terminate the calling process


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     <B>#include</B> <B>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</B>

     <I>void</I>
     <B>_exit</B>(<I>int</I> <I>status</I>)


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     The <B>_exit</B>() function terminates a process with the following conse-
     quences:

     <B>o</B>	 All of the descriptors open in the calling process are closed.  This
	 may entail delays, for example, waiting for output to drain; a pro-
	 cess in this state may not be killed, as it is already dying.

     <B>o</B>	 If the parent process of the calling process has an outstanding
	 <B><A HREF="wait.html">wait(2)</A></B> call or catches the SIGCHLD signal, it is notified of the
	 calling process's termination and the <I>status</I> is set as defined by
	 <B><A HREF="wait.html">wait(2)</A></B>.

     <B>o</B>	 The parent process-ID of all of the calling process's existing child
	 processes are set to 1; the initialization process (see the DEFINI-
	 TIONS section of <B><A HREF="intro.html">intro(2)</A></B>)  inherits each of these processes.

     <B>o</B>	 If the termination of the process causes any process group to become
	 orphaned (usually because the parents of all members of the group
	 have now exited; see ``orphaned process group'' in <B><A HREF="intro.html">intro(2)</A></B>),	and if
	 any member of the orphaned group is stopped, the SIGHUP signal and
	 the SIGCONT signal are sent to all members of the newly-orphaned pro-
	 cess group.

     <B>o</B>	 If the process is a controlling process (see <B><A HREF="intro.html">intro(2)</A></B>),  the SIGHUP
	 signal is sent to the foreground process group of the controlling
	 terminal, and all current access to the controlling terminal is re-
	 voked.

     Most C programs call the library routine <B><A HREF="exit.html">exit(3)</A></B>,	which flushes buffers,
     closes streams, unlinks temporary files, etc., before calling <B>_exit</B>().


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
     <B>_exit</B>() can never return.

</PRE>
<H2>STANDARDS</H2><PRE>
     The <B>_exit</B>() function call is expected to conform to IEEE Std1003.1-1990
     (``POSIX'').


</PRE>
<H2>HISTORY</H2><PRE>
     An <B>_exit</B>() function call appeared in Version 7 AT&amp;T UNIX.
