     <B>accept</B> - accept a connection on a socket

     <B>accept</B>(<I>int</I> <I>s</I>, <I>struct</I> <I>sockaddr</I> <I>*addr</I>, <I>int</I> <I>*addrlen</I>)


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     The argument <I>s</I> is a socket that has been created with <B><A HREF="socket.html">socket(2)</A></B>,  bound
     to an address with <B><A HREF="bind.html">bind(2)</A></B>,  and is listening for connections after a
     <B><A HREF="listen.html">listen(2)</A></B>.  The <B>accept</B>() argument extracts the first connection request
     on the queue of pending connections, creates a new socket with the same
     properties of <I>s</I> and allocates a new file descriptor for the socket.  If
     no pending connections are present on the queue, and the socket is not
     marked as non-blocking, <B>accept</B>() blocks the caller until a connection is
     present.  If the socket is marked non-blocking and no pending connections
     are present on the queue, <B>accept</B>() returns an error as described below.
     The accepted socket may not be used to accept more connections.  The
     original socket <I>s</I> remains open.

     The argument <I>addr</I> is a result parameter that is filled in with the ad-
     dress of the connecting entity, as known to the communications layer.
     The exact format of the <I>addr</I> parameter is determined by the domain in
     which the communication is occurring.  The <I>addrlen</I> is a value-result pa-
     rameter; it should initially contain the amount of space pointed to by
     <I>addr</I>; on return it will contain the actual length (in bytes) of the ad-
     dress returned.  This call is used with connection-based socket types,
     currently with SOCK_STREAM.

     It is possible to <B><A HREF="select.html">select(2)</A></B> a socket for the purposes of doing an
     <B>accept</B>() by selecting it for read.

     For certain protocols which require an explicit confirmation, such as ISO
     or DATAKIT, <B>accept</B>() can be thought of as merely dequeueing the next con-
     nection request and not implying confirmation.  Confirmation can be im-
     plied by a normal read or write on the new file descriptor, and rejection
     can be implied by closing the new socket.

     One can obtain user connection request data without confirming the con-
     nection by issuing a <B><A HREF="recv.html">recvmsg(2)</A></B> call with an <I>msg</I><B>_</B><I>iovlen</I> of 0 and a non-
     zero <I>msg</I><B>_</B><I>controllen</I>, or by issuing a <B><A HREF="getsockopt.html">getsockopt(2)</A></B> request.  Similarly,
     one can provide user connection rejection information by issuing a
     <B><A HREF="send.html">sendmsg(2)</A></B> call with providing only the control information, or by call-
     ing <B><A HREF="getsockopt.html">setsockopt(2)</A></B>.


</PRE>
<H2>IMPLEMENTATION NOTES</H2><PRE>
     In the non-threaded library <B>accept</B>() is implemented as the <I>accept</I>
     syscall.

     In the threaded library, the <I>accept</I> syscall is assembled to
     <B>_thread_sys_accept</B>() and <B>accept</B>() is implemented as a function which
     locks <I>s</I> for read and write, then calls <B>_thread_sys_accept</B>().  If the call
     to <B>_thread_sys_accept</B>() would block, a context switch is performed. Be-
     fore returning, <B>accept</B>() unlocks <I>s</I>.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUES</H2><PRE>
     The call returns -1 on error.  If it succeeds, it returns a non-negative
     integer that is a descriptor for the accepted socket.


</PRE>
<H2>ERRORS</H2><PRE>
     The <B>accept</B>() will fail if:

     [EBADF]	  The descriptor is invalid.

     [EINTR]	  The <B>accept</B>() operation was interrupted.

     [EMFILE]	  The per-process descriptor table is full.

     [ENFILE]	  The system file table is full.

     [ENOTSOCK]   The descriptor references a file, not a socket.

     [EINVAL]	  <B><A HREF="listen.html">listen(2)</A></B> has not been called on the socket descriptor.

     [EFAULT]	  The <I>addr</I> parameter is not in a writable part of the user ad-
		  dress space.

     [EWOULDBLOCK]
		  The socket is marked non-blocking and no connections are
		  present to be accepted.
