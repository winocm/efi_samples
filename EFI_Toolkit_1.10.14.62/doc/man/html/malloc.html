<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     The <B>malloc</B>() function allocates <I>size</I> bytes of memory.  The allocated
     space is suitably aligned (after possible pointer coercion) for storage
     of any type of object.  If the space is at least <I>pagesize</I> bytes in length
     (see getpagesize((3)),) the returned memory will be page boundary aligned
     as well.  If <B>malloc</B>() fails, a NULL pointer is returned.

     The <B>calloc</B>() function allocates space for <I>number</I> objects, each <I>size</I> bytes
     in length.  The result is identical to calling <B>malloc</B>() with an argument
     of ``number * size'', with the exception that the allocated memory is
     initialized to nul bytes.

     The <B>realloc</B>() function changes the size of the previously allocated memo-
     ry referenced by <I>ptr</I> to <I>size</I> bytes.  The contents of the memory are un-
     changed up to the lesser of the new and old sizes.  If the new size is
     larger, the value of the newly allocated portion of the memory is unde-
     fined.  If the requested memory cannot be allocated, NULL is returned and
     the memory referenced by <I>ptr</I> is valid and unchanged.  If <I>ptr</I> is NULL, the
     <B>realloc</B>() function behaves identically to <B>malloc</B>() for the specified
     size.

     The <B>reallocf</B>() function call is identical to the realloc function call,
     except that it will free the passed pointer when the requested memory
     cannot be allocated.  This is a FreeBSD specific API designed to ease the
     problems with traditional coding styles for realloc causing memory leaks
     in libraries.

     The <B>free</B>() function causes the allocated memory referenced by <I>ptr</I> to be
     made available for future allocations.  If <I>ptr</I> is NULL, no action occurs.


</PRE>
<H2>TUNING</H2><PRE>
     Once, when the first call is made to one of these memory allocation rou-
     tines, various flags will be set or reset, which affect the workings of
     this allocation implementation.

     The ``name'' of the file referenced by the symbolic link named
     <I>/etc/malloc.conf</I>, the value of the environment variable MALLOC_OPTIONS,
     and the string pointed to by the global variable <I>malloc</I><B>_</B><I>options</I> will be
     interpreted, in that order, character by character as flags.

     Most flags are single letters, where uppercase indicates that the behav-
     ior is set, or on, and lowercase means that the behavior is not set, or
     off.

     A	     All warnings (except for the warning about unknown flags being
	     set), and failure to allocate memory become fatal.  The process
	     will call <B><A HREF="abort.html">abort(3)</A></B> in these cases.

     J	     Each byte of new memory allocated by <B>malloc</B>(), <B>realloc</B>() or
	     <B>reallocf</B>() as well as all memory returned by <B>free</B>(), <B>realloc</B>() or
	     <B>reallocf</B>() will be initialized to 0xd0.  This options also sets
	     the ``R'' option.	This is intended for debugging and will impact
	     performance negatively.

     H	     Pass a hint to the kernel about pages unused by the allocation
	     functions.  This will help performance if the system is paging
	     excessively.  This option is off by default.

     R	     Causes the <B>realloc</B>() and <B>reallocf</B>() functions to always reallo-
	     cate memory even if the initial allocation was sufficiently
	     large.  This can substantially aid in compacting memory.

     U	     Generate ``utrace'' entries for <B><A HREF="ktrace.html">ktrace(1)</A></B>,  for all operations.
	     Consult the source for details on this option.

     V	     Attempting to allocate zero bytes will return a NULL pointer in-
	     stead of a valid pointer.	(The default behavior is to make a
	     minimal allocation and return a pointer to it.)  This option is
	     provided for System V compatibility.  This option is incompatible
	     with the ``X'' option.

     X	     Rather than return failure for any allocation function, display a
	     diagnostic message on stderr and cause the program to drop core
	     (using <B>abort</B>(<I>3</I>, <I>).</I>) This option should be set at compile time by
	     including the following in the source code:

		   extern char *malloc_options;
		   malloc_options = "X";

     Z	     This option implicitly sets the ``J'' and ``R'' options, and then
	     zeros out the bytes that were requested.  This is intended for
	     debugging and will impact performance negatively.

     &lt;	     Reduce the size of the cache by a factor of two.  The default
	     cache size is 16 pages.  This option can be specified multiple
	     times.

     &gt;	     Double the size of the cache by a factor of two.  The default
	     cache size is 16 pages.  This option can be specified multiple
	     times.

     The ``J'' and ``Z'' options are intended for testing and debugging.  An
     application which changes its behavior when these options are used is
     flawed.


</PRE>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2><PRE>
     To set a systemwide reduction of cache size, and to dump core whenever a
     problem occurs:

	   ln -s 'A&lt;' /etc/malloc.conf

     To specify in the source that a program does no return value checking on
     calls to these functions:

	   extern char *malloc_options;
	   malloc_options = "X";


</PRE>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2><PRE>
     The following environment variables affect the execution of the alloca-
     tion functions:

     MALLOC_OPTIONS
	  If the environment variable MALLOC_OPTIONS is set, the characters it
	  contains will be interpreted as flags to the allocation functions.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUES</H2><PRE>
     The <B>malloc</B>() and <B>calloc</B>() functions return a pointer to the allocated
     memory if successful; otherwise a NULL pointer is returned.

     The <B>realloc</B>() and <B>reallocf</B>() functions return a pointer, possibly identi-
     cal to <I>ptr</I>, to the allocated memory if successful; otherwise a NULL
     pointer is returned, in which case the memory referenced by <I>ptr</I> is still
     available and intact.

     The <B>free</B>() function returns no value.


</PRE>
<H2>DEBUGGING MALLOC PROBLEMS</H2><PRE>
     The major difference between this implementation and other allocation im-
     plementations is that the free pages are not accessed unless allocated,
     and are aggressively returned to the kernel for reuse.

	   Most allocation implementations will store a data structure con-
	   taining a linked list in the free chunks of memory, used to tie all
	   the free memory together.  That can be suboptimal, as every time
	   the free-list is traversed, the otherwise unused, and likely paged
	   out, pages are faulted into primary memory.	On systems which are
	   paging, this can result in a factor of five increase in the number
	   of page-faults done by a process.

     A side effect of this architecture is that many minor transgressions on
     the interface which would traditionally not be detected are in fact de-
     tected.  As a result, programs that have been running happily for years
     may suddenly start to complain loudly, when linked with this allocation
     implementation.

     The first and most important thing to do is to set the ``A'' option.
     This option forces a coredump (if possible) at the first sign of trouble,
     rather than the normal policy of trying to continue if at all possible.

     It is probably also a good idea to recompile the program with suitable
     options and symbols for debugger support.

     If the program starts to give unusual results, coredump or generally be-
     have differently without emitting any of the messages listed in the next
     section, it is likely because it depends on the storage being filled with
     nul bytes.  Try running it with ``Z'' option set; if that improves the
     situation, this diagnosis has been confirmed.  If the program still mis-
     behaves, the likely problem is accessing memory outside the allocated
     area, more likely after than before the allocated area.

     Alternatively, if the symptoms are not easy to reproduce, setting the
     ``J'' option may help provoke the problem.

     In truly difficult cases, the ``U'' option, if supported by the kernel,
     can provide a detailed trace of all calls made to these functions.

     Unfortunately this implementation does not provide much detail about the
     problems it detects, the performance impact for storing such information
     would be prohibitive.  There are a number of allocation implementations
     available on the 'Net which focus on detecting and pinpointing problems
     by trading performance for extra sanity checks and detailed diagnostics.


</PRE>
<H2>DIAGNOSTIC MESSAGES</H2><PRE>
     If <B>malloc</B>(), <B>calloc</B>(), <B>realloc</B>() or <B>free</B>() detect an error or warning
     condition, a message will be printed to file descriptor STDERR_FILENO.
     Errors will result in the process dumping core.  If the ``A'' option is
     set, all warnings are treated as errors.

     The following is a brief description of possible error messages and their
     meanings:

     (ES): mumble mumble mumble
	     The allocation functions were compiled with ``EXTRA_SANITY'' de-
	     fined, and an error was found during the additional error check-
	     ing.  Consult the source code for further information.

     allocation failed
	     If the ``A'' option is specified it is a fatal error for an allo-
	     cation function to fail.

     <B><A HREF="mmap.html">mmap(2)</A></B> failed, check limits
	     This most likely means that the system is dangerously overloaded
	     or that the process' limits are incorrectly specified.

     freelist is destroyed
	     The internal free-list has been corrupted.

     The following is a brief description of possible warning messages and
     their meanings:

     chunk/page is already free
	     The process attempted to <B>free</B>() memory which had already been
	     freed.

     junk pointer ...
	     A pointer specified to one of the allocation functions points
	     outside the bounds of the memory of which they are aware.

     malloc() has never been called
	     No memory has been allocated, yet something is being freed or re-
	     alloc'ed.

     modified (chunk-/page-) pointer
	     The pointer passed to <B>free</B>() or <B>realloc</B>() has been modified.

     pointer to wrong page
	     The pointer that <B>malloc</B>() or <B>calloc</B>() is trying to free does not
	     reference a possible page.

     recursive call
	     A process has attempted to call an allocation function recursive-
	     ly.  This is not permitted.  In particular, signal handlers
	     should not attempt to allocate memory.

     out of memory
	     The ``X'' option was specified and an allocation of memory
	     failed.

     unknown char in MALLOC_OPTIONS
	     An unknown option was specified.  Even with the ``A'' option set,
	     this warning is still only a warning.

</PRE>
<H2>STANDARDS</H2><PRE>
     The <B>malloc</B>(), <B>calloc</B>(), <B>realloc</B>() and <B>free</B>() functions conform to ISO
     9899: 1990 (``ISO C'').


</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
     The messages printed in case of problems provide no detail about the ac-
     tual values.

     It can be argued that returning a null pointer when asked to allocate ze-
     ro bytes is a silly response to a silly question.

</PRE>
<H2>HISTORY</H2><PRE>
     The present allocation implementation started out as a filesystem for a
     drum attached to a 20bit binary challenged computer which was built with
     discrete germanium transistors.  It has since graduated to handle primary
     storage rather than secondary.  It first appeared in its new shape and
     ability in FreeBSD 2.2.
