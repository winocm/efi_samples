<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     The routines <B>addr2ascii</B>() and <B>ascii2addr</B>() are used to convert network
     addresses between binary form and a printable form appropriate to the ad-
     dress family.  Both functions take an <I>af</I> argument, specifying the address
     family to be used in the conversion process.  (Currently, only the
     AF_INET and AF_LINK address families are supported.)

     The <B>addr2ascii</B>() function is used to convert binary, network-format ad-
     dresses into printable form.  In addition to <I>af</I>, there are three other
     arguments.  The <I>addrp</I> argument is a pointer to the network address to be
     converted.  The <I>len</I> argument is the length of the address.  The <I>buf</I> argu-
     ment is an optional pointer to a caller-allocated buffer to hold the re-
     sult; if a null pointer is passed, <B>addr2ascii</B>() uses a statically-allo-
     cated buffer.

     The <B>ascii2addr</B>() function performs the inverse operation to <B>addr2ascii</B>().
     In addition to <I>af</I>, it takes two parameters, <I>ascii</I> and <I>result</I>. The <I>ascii</I>
     parameter is a pointer to the string which is to be converted into bina-
     ry.  The <I>result</I> parameter is a pointer to an appropriate network address
     structure for the specified family.

     The following gives the appropriate structure to use for binary addresses
     in the specified family:

     AF_INET	  struct in_addr (in &lt;<I>netinet/in.h</I>&gt;)
     AF_LINK	  struct sockaddr_dl (in &lt;<I>net/if</I><B>_</B><I>dl.h</I>&gt;)


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUES</H2><PRE>
     The <B>addr2ascii</B>() function returns the address of the buffer it was
     passed, or a static buffer if the a null pointer was passed; on failure,
     it returns a null pointer.  The <B>ascii2addr</B>() function returns the length
     of the binary address in bytes, or -1 on failure.


</PRE>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2><PRE>
     The <B><A HREF="inet.html">inet(3)</A></B> functions <B>inet_ntoa</B>() and <B>inet_aton</B>() could be implemented
     thusly:

	   #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
	   #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
	   #include &lt;netinet/in.h&gt;
	   #include &lt;arpa/inet.h&gt;

	   char *
	   inet_ntoa(struct in_addr addr)
	   {
		   return addr2ascii(AF_INET, &amp;addr, sizeof addr, 0);
	   }

	   int
	   inet_aton(const char *ascii, struct in_addr *addr)
	   {
		   return (ascii2addr(AF_INET, ascii, addr)
		       == sizeof(*addr));
	   }

     In actuality, this cannot be done because <B>addr2ascii</B>() and <B>ascii2addr</B>()
     are implemented in terms of the <B><A HREF="inet.html">inet(3)</A></B> functions, rather than the other
     way around.


</PRE>
<H2>ERRORS</H2><PRE>
     When a failure is returned, errno is set to one of the following values:

     [ENAMETOOLONG]	The <B>addr2ascii</B>() routine was passed a <I>len</I> parameter
			which was inappropriate for the address family given
			by <I>af</I>.

     [EPROTONOSUPPORT]	Either routine was passed an <I>af</I> parameter other than
			AF_INET or AF_LINK.

     [EINVAL]		The string passed to <B>ascii2addr</B>() was improperly for-
			matted for address family <I>af</I>.

<H2>HISTORY</H2><PRE>
     An interface close to this one was originally suggested by Craig Par-
     tridge.  This particular interface originally appeared in the INRIA IPv6
     implementation.

<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
     The original implementations supported IPv6.  This support should eventu-
     ally be resurrected.  The NRL implementation also included support for
     the AF_ISO and AF_NS address families.

     The genericity of this interface is somewhat questionable.  A truly
     generic interface would provide a means for determining the length of the
     buffer to be used so that it could be dynamically allocated, and would
     always require a ``struct sockaddr'' to hold the binary address.  Unfor-
     tunately, this is incompatible with existing practice.  This limitation
     means that a routine for printing network addresses from arbitrary ad-
     dress families must still have internal knowledge of the maximum buffer
     length needed and the appropriate part of the address to use as the bina-
     ry address.
