<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     This describes a general terminal line discipline that is supported on
     tty asynchronous communication ports.

   <B>Opening</B> <B>a</B> <B>Terminal</B> <B>Device</B> <B>File</B>
     When a terminal file is opened, it normally causes the process to wait
     until a connection is established.  For most hardware, the presence of a
     connection is indicated by the assertion of the hardware CARRIER line. If
     the termios structure associated with the terminal file has the CLOCAL
     flag set in the cflag, or if the O_NONBLOCK flag is set in the <B><A HREF="open.html">open(2)</A></B>
     call, then the open will succeed even without a connection being present.

   <B>Input</B> <B>Processing</B> <B>and</B> <B>Reading</B> <B>Data</B>
     The EFI Applicaiton Toolkit implementation of the tty only supports the
     noncanonical mode.

     Input processing depends on whether the O_NONBLOCK flag is set by <B><A HREF="open.html">open(2)</A></B>
     or <B><A HREF="fcntl.html">fcntl(2)</A></B>.  If the O_NONBLOCK flag is clear, then the read request is
     blocked until enough data to satisfy the read is available.  If the
     O_NONBLOCK flag is set, then the read request is completed, without
     blocking, in one of three ways:

	   1.	If there is enough data available to satisfy the entire re-
		quest, and the read completes successfully the number of bytes
		read is returned.

	   2.	If there is not enough data available to satisfy the entire
		request, and the read completes successfully, having read as
		much data as possible, the number of bytes read is returned.

	   3.	If there is no data available, the read returns -1, with errno
		set to EAGAIN.

   <B>Noncanonical</B> <B>Mode</B> <B>Input</B> <B>Processing</B>
     In noncanonical mode input processing, input bytes are not assembled into
     lines, and erase and kill processing does not occur.  The values of the
     VMIN and VTIME members of the <I>c</I><B>_</B><I>cc</I> array are used to determine how to
     process the bytes received.

     MIN represents the minimum number of bytes that should be received when
     the <B><A HREF="read.html">read(2)</A></B> function successfully returns.  TIME is a timer of 0.1 second
     granularity that is used to time out bursty and short term data transmis-
     sions.  If MIN is greater than { MAX_INPUT}, the response to the request
     is undefined.  The four possible values for MIN and TIME and their inter-
     actions are described below.

   <B>Case</B> <B>A:</B> <B>MIN</B> <B>&gt;</B> <B>0,</B> <B>TIME</B> <B>&gt;</B> <B>0</B>
     In this case TIME serves as an inter-byte timer and is activated after
     the first byte is received.  Since it is an inter-byte timer, it is reset
     after a byte is received.	The interaction between MIN and TIME is as
     follows:  as soon as one byte is received, the inter-byte timer is start-
     ed.  If MIN bytes are received before the inter-byte timer expires (re-
     member that the timer is reset upon receipt of each byte), the read is
     satisfied.  If the timer expires before MIN bytes are received, the char-
     acters received to that point are returned to the user.  Note that if
     TIME expires at least one byte is returned because the timer would not
     have been enabled unless a byte was received.  In this case (MIN &gt; 0,
     TIME &gt; 0) the read blocks until the MIN and TIME mechanisms are activated
     by the receipt of the first byte, or a signal is received.  If data is in
     the buffer at the time of the <B>read</B>(), the result is as if data had been
     received immediately after the <B>read</B>().

   <B>Case</B> <B>B:</B> <B>MIN</B> <B>&gt;</B> <B>0,</B> <B>TIME</B> <B>=</B> <B>0</B>
     In this case, since the value of TIME is zero, the timer plays no role
     and only MIN is significant.  A pending read is not satisfied until MIN
     bytes are received (i.e., the pending read blocks until MIN bytes are re-
     ceived), or a signal is received.	A program that uses this case to read
     record-based terminal I/O may block indefinitely in the read operation.

   <B>Case</B> <B>C:</B> <B>MIN</B> <B>=</B> <B>0,</B> <B>TIME</B> <B>&gt;</B> <B>0</B>
     In this case, since MIN = 0, TIME no longer represents an inter-byte
     timer.  It now serves as a read timer that is activated as soon as the
     read function is processed.  A read is satisfied as soon as a single byte
     is received or the read timer expires.  Note that in this case if the
     timer expires, no bytes are returned.  If the timer does not expire, the
     only way the read can be satisfied is if a byte is received.  In this
     case the read will not block indefinitely waiting for a byte; if no byte
     is received within TIME*0.1 seconds after the read is initiated, the read
     returns a value of zero, having read no data.  If data is in the buffer
     at the time of the read, the timer is started as if data had been re-
     ceived immediately after the read.

   <B>Case</B> <B>D:</B> <B>MIN</B> <B>=</B> <B>0,</B> <B>TIME</B> <B>=</B> <B>0</B>
     The minimum of either the number of bytes requested or the number of
     bytes currently available is returned without waiting for more bytes to
     be input.	If no characters are available, read returns a value of zero,
     having read no data.

   <B>Writing</B> <B>Data</B> <B>and</B> <B>Output</B> <B>Processing</B>
     When a process writes one or more bytes to a terminal device file, they
     are processed according to the <I>c</I><B>_</B><I>oflag</I> field (see the <I>Output</I> <I>Modes</I> sec-
     tion).  The implementation may provide a buffering mechanism; as such,
     when a call to <B>write</B>() completes, all of the bytes written have been
     scheduled for transmission to the device, but the transmission will not
     necessarily have been completed.

   <B>Modem</B> <B>Disconnect</B>
     If a modem disconnect is detected by the terminal interface and if CLOCAL
     is not set in the <I>c</I><B>_</B><I>cflag</I> field for the terminal, any subsequent call
     to the <B>read</B>() function returns the value zero, indicating end of file.
     Thus, processes that read a terminal file and test for end-of-file can
     terminate appropriately after a disconnect.  Any subsequent <B>write</B>() to
     the terminal device returns -1, with <I>errno</I> set to EIO, until the device
     is closed.

<H2>General Terminal Interface</H2><PRE>
   <B>Parameters</B> <B>That</B> <B>Can</B> <B>Be</B> <B>Set</B>
     Routines that need to control certain terminal I/O characteristics do so
     by using the termios structure as defined in the header &lt;<I>termios.h</I>&gt;. This
     structure contains minimally four scalar elements of bit flags and one
     array of special characters.  The scalar flag elements are named:
     <I>c</I><B>_</B><I>iflag</I>, <I>c</I><B>_</B><I>oflag</I>, <I>c</I><B>_</B><I>cflag</I>, and <I>c</I><B>_</B><I>lflag</I>. The character array is named
     <I>c</I><B>_</B><I>cc</I>, and its maximum index is NCCS.

   <B>Control</B> <B>Modes</B>
     Values of the <I>c</I><B>_</B><I>cflag</I> field describe the basic terminal hardware control,
     and are composed of the following masks.  Not all values specified are
     supported by all hardware.

	   CSIZE       /* character size mask */
	   CS5	       /* 5 bits (pseudo) */
	   CS6	       /* 6 bits */
	   CS7	       /* 7 bits */

	   CS8	       /* 8 bits */
	   CSTOPB      /* send 2 stop bits */
	   CREAD       /* enable receiver */
	   PARENB      /* parity enable */
	   PARODD      /* odd parity, else even */
	   HUPCL       /* hang up on last close */
	   CLOCAL      /* ignore modem status lines */
	   CCTS_OFLOW  /* CTS flow control of output */
	   CRTSCTS     /* same as CCTS_OFLOW */
	   CRTS_IFLOW  /* RTS flow control of input */
	   MDMBUF      /* flow control output via Carrier */

     The CSIZE bits specify the byte size in bits for both transmission and
     reception.  The <I>c</I><B>_</B><I>cflag</I> is masked with CSIZE and compared with the values
     CS5, CS6, CS7, or CS8. This size does not include the parity bit, if any.
     If CSTOPB is set, two stop bits are used, otherwise one stop bit.	For
     example, at 110 baud, two stop bits are normally used.

     If CREAD is set, the receiver is enabled.	Otherwise, no character is re-
     ceived.  Not all hardware supports this bit.  In fact, this flag is pret-
     ty silly and if it were not part of the <B>termios</B> specification it would be
     omitted.

     If PARENB is set, parity generation and detection are enabled and a pari-
     ty bit is added to each character.  If parity is enabled, PARODD speci-
     fies odd parity if set, otherwise even parity is used.

     If HUPCL is set, the modem control lines for the port are lowered when
     the last process with the port open closes the port or the process termi-
     nates.  The modem connection is broken.

     If CLOCAL is set, a connection does not depend on the state of the modem
     status lines.  If CLOCAL is clear, the modem status lines are monitored.

     Under normal circumstances, a call to the <B>open</B>() function waits for the
     modem connection to complete.  However, if the O_NONBLOCK flag is set or
     if CLOCAL has been set, the <B>open</B>() function returns immediately without
     waiting for the connection.

     The CCTS_OFLOW (CRTSCTS) flag is currently unused.

     If MDMBUF is set then output flow control is controlled by the state of
     Carrier Detect.

     If the object for which the control modes are set is not an asynchronous
     serial connection, some of the modes may be ignored; for example, if an
     attempt is made to set the baud rate on a network connection to a termi-
     nal on another host, the baud rate may or may not be set on the connec-
     tion between that terminal and the machine it is directly connected to.
