     <B>ed</B> - text editor


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     <B>ed</B> [<B>-</B>] [<B>-sx</B>] [<B>-p</B> <I>string</I>] [<I>file</I>]


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <B>Ed</B> is a line-oriented text editor.  It is used to create, display, modify
     and otherwise manipulate text files.

     If invoked with a <I>file</I> argument, then a copy of <I>file</I> is read into the ed-
     itor's buffer.  Changes are made to this copy and not directly to <I>file</I>
     itself.  Upon quitting <B>ed</B>, any changes not explicitly saved  with a <I>w</I>
     command are lost.

     Editing is done in two distinct modes: <I>command</I> and <I>input</I>. When first in-
     voked, <B>ed</B> is in command mode.  In this mode commands are read from the
     standard input and executed to manipulate the contents of the editor
     buffer.  A typical command might look like:

     <B>,s</B>/<I>old</I>/<I>new</I>/<B>g</B>

     which replaces all occurrences of the string <I>old</I> with <I>new</I>.

     When an input command, such as <I>a</I> (append), <I>i</I> (insert) or <I>c</I> (change), is
     given, <B>ed</B> enters input mode.  This is the primary means of adding text to
     a file.  In this mode, no commands are available; instead, the standard
     input is written directly to the editor buffer.  Lines consist of text up
     to and including a <I>newline</I> character.  Input mode is terminated by enter-
     ing a single period (.) on a line.

     All <B>ed</B> commands operate on whole lines or ranges of lines; e.g., the <I>d</I>
     command deletes lines; the <I>m</I> command moves lines, and so on.  It is pos-
     sible to modify only a portion of a line by means of replacement, as in
     the example above.  However even here, the <I>s</I> command is applied to whole
     lines at a time.

     In general, <B>ed</B> commands consist of zero or more line addresses, followed
     by a single character command and possibly additional parameters; i.e.,
     commands have the structure:

     [address [,address]]command[parameters]

     The address(es) indicate the line or range of lines to be affected by the
     command.  If fewer addresses are given than the command accepts, then de-
     fault addresses are supplied.


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     The following options are available:

     <B>-s</B>      Suppress diagnostics. This should be used if <B>ed</B>'s standard input
	     is from a script.

     <B>-x</B>      Prompt for an encryption key to be used in subsequent reads and
	     writes (see the <I>x</I> command).

     <B>-p</B> <I>string</I>
	     Specify a command prompt.	This may be toggled on and off with
	     the <I>P</I> command.

     <I>file</I>    Specify the name of a file to read.  If <I>file</I> is prefixed with a
	     bang (!), then it is interpreted as a shell command.  In this
	     case, what is read is the standard output of <I>file</I> executed via
	     <B><A HREF="sh.html">sh(1)</A></B>.  To read a file whose name begins with a bang, prefix the
	     name with a backslash (\).  The default filename is set to <I>file</I>
	     only if it is not prefixed with a bang.


</PRE>
<H2>LINE ADDRESSING</H2><PRE>
     An address represents the number of a line in the buffer.	<B>Ed</B> maintains a
     <I>current</I> <I>address</I> which is typically supplied to commands as the default
     address when none is specified.  When a file is first read,  the current
     address is set to the last line of the file.  In general, the current ad-
     dress is set to the last line affected by a command.

     A line address is constructed from one of the bases in the list below,
     optionally followed by a numeric offset.  The offset may include any com-
     bination of digits, operators (i.e., <I>+</I>, <I>-</I> and <I>^</I>) and whitespace.  Ad-
     dresses are read from left to right, and their values are computed rela-
     tive to the current address.

     One exception to the rule that addresses represent line numbers is the
     address <I>0</I> (zero).	This means "before the first line," and is legal wher-
     ever it makes sense.

     An address range is two addresses separated either by a comma or semi-
     colon. The value of the first address in a range cannot exceed the value
     of the second.  If only one address is given in a range, then the second
     address is set to the given address.  If an <I>n</I>-tuple of addresses is given
     where <I>n</I> <I>&gt;</I> <I>2</I>, then the corresponding range is determined by the last two
     addresses in the <I>n</I>-tuple. If only one address is expected, then the last
     address is used.

     Each address in a comma-delimited range is interpreted relative to the
     current address.  In a semi-colon-delimited range, the first address is
     used to set the current address, and the second address is interpreted
     relative to the first.

     The following address symbols are recognized:

     .	     The current line (address) in the buffer.

     $	     The last line in the buffer.

     n	     The <I>n</I>th, line in the buffer where <I>n</I> is a number in the range
	     <I>[0,$]</I>.

     - or ^  The previous line.  This is equivalent to <I>-1</I> and may be repeated
	     with cumulative effect.

     -n or ^n
	     The <I>n</I>th previous line, where <I>n</I> is a non-negative number.

     +	     The next line.  This is equivalent to <I>+1</I> and may be repeated with
	     cumulative effect.

     +n      The <I>n</I>th next line, where <I>n</I> is a non-negative number.

     , or %  The first through last lines in the buffer.  This is equivalent
	     to the address range <I>1,$</I>.

     ;	     The current through last lines in the buffer.  This is equivalent
	     to the address range <I>.,$</I>.

     /re/    The next line containing the regular expression <I>re</I>. The search
	     wraps to the beginning of the buffer and continues down to the
	     current line, if necessary.  // repeats the last search.

     ?re?    The previous line containing the regular expression <I>re</I>. The
	     search wraps to the end of the buffer and continues up to the
	     current line, if necessary.  ?? repeats the last search.

     'lc     The line previously marked by a <I>k</I> (mark) command, where <I>lc</I> is a
	     lower case letter.


</PRE>
<H2>REGULAR EXPRESSIONS</H2><PRE>
     Regular expressions are patterns used in selecting text.  For example,
     the command:

     <B>g</B>/<I>string</I>/

     prints all lines containing <I>string</I>. Regular expressions are also used by
     the <I>s</I> command for selecting old text to be replaced with new.

     In addition to a specifying string literals, regular expressions can rep-
     resent classes of strings.  Strings thus represented are said to be
     matched by the corresponding regular expression.  If it is possible for a
     regular expression to match several strings in a line, then the left-most
     longest match is the one selected.

     The following symbols are used in constructing regular expressions:

     c	     Any character <I>c</I> not listed below, including `{', '}', `(', `)',
	     `&lt;' and `&gt;', matches itself.

     \c      Any backslash-escaped character <I>c</I>, except for `{', '}', `(', `)',
	     `&lt;' and `&gt;', matches itself.

     .	     Match any single character.

     [char-class]
	     Match any single character in <I>char-class</I>. To include a  `]' in
	     <I>char-class</I>, it must be the first character.  A range of charac-
	     ters may be specified by separating the end characters of the
	     range with a `-', e.g., `a-z' specifies the lower case charac-
	     ters.  The following literal expressions can also be used in
	     <I>char-class</I> to specify sets of characters:

	       [:alnum:]  [:cntrl:]  [:lower:]	[:space:]
	       [:alpha:]  [:digit:]  [:print:]	[:upper:]
	       [:blank:]  [:graph:]  [:punct:]	[:xdigit:]

	     If `-' appears as the first or last character of <I>char-class</I>, then
	     it matches itself.  All other characters in <I>char-class</I> match
	     themselves.

	     Patterns in <I>char-class</I> of the form:

	       [.<I>col-elm</I>.] or,	 [=<I>col-elm</I>=]

	     where <I>col-elm</I> is a <I>collating</I> <I>element</I> are interpreted according to
	     <B><A HREF="locale.html">locale(5)</A></B> (not currently supported).  See <B><A HREF="regex.html">regex(3)</A></B> for an expla-
	     nation of these constructs.

     [^char-class]
	     Match any single character, other than newline, not in <I>char-</I>
	     <I>class</I>. <I>Char-class</I> is defined as above.

     ^	     If <I>^</I> is the first character of a regular expression, then it an-
	     chors the regular expression to the beginning of a line.  Other-
	     wise, it matches itself.

     $	     If <I>$</I> is the last character of a regular expression, it anchors
	     the regular expression to the end of a line.  Otherwise, it

	     matches itself.

     \&lt;      Anchor the single character regular expression or subexpression
	     immediately following it to the beginning of a word.  (This may
	     not be available)

     \&gt;      Anchor the single character regular expression or subexpression
	     immediately following it to the end of a word.  (This may not be
	     available)

     \(re\)  Define a subexpression <I>re</I>. Subexpressions may be nested.  A sub-
	     sequent backreference of the form \n, where <I>n</I> is a number in the
	     range [1,9], expands to the text matched by the <I>n</I>th subexpres-
	     sion.  For example, the regular expression `\(.*\)\1' matches any
	     string consisting of identical adjacent substrings.  Subexpres-
	     sions are ordered relative to their left delimiter.

     *	     Match the single character regular expression or subexpression
	     immediately preceding it zero or more times.  If <I>*</I> is the first
	     character of a regular expression or subexpression, then it
	     matches itself.  The <I>*</I> operator sometimes yields unexpected re-
	     sults.  For example, the regular expression `b*' matches the be-
	     ginning of the string `abbb' (as opposed to the substring `bbb'),
	     since a null match is the only left-most match.

     \{n,m\} or \{n,\} or \{n\}
	     Match the single character regular expression or subexpression
	     immediately preceding it at least <I>n</I> and at most <I>m</I> times.  If <I>m</I> is
	     omitted, then it matches at least <I>n</I> times.  If the comma is also
	     omitted, then it matches exactly <I>n</I> times.

     Additional regular expression operators may be defined depending on the
     particular <B><A HREF="regex.html">regex(3)</A></B> implementation.


</PRE>
<H2>COMMANDS</H2><PRE>
     All <B>ed</B> commands are single characters, though some require additional pa-
     rameters.	If a command's parameters extend over several lines, then each
     line except for the last must be terminated with a backslash (\).

     In general, at most one command is allowed per line.  However, most com-
     mands accept a print suffix, which is any of <I>p</I> (print), <I>l</I> (list) , or <I>n</I>
     (enumerate), to print the last line affected by the command.

     An interrupt (typically ^C) has the effect of aborting the current com-
     mand and returning the editor to command mode.

     <B>Ed</B> recognizes the following commands.  The commands are shown together
     with the default address or address range supplied if none is specified
     (in parenthesis).

     (.)a    Append text to the buffer after the addressed line.  Text is en-
	     tered in input mode.  The current address is set to last line en-
	     tered.

     (.,.)c  Change lines in the buffer.  The addressed lines are deleted from
	     the buffer, and text is appended in their place.  Text is entered
	     in input mode.  The current address is set to last line entered.

     (.,.)d  Delete the addressed lines from the buffer.  If there is a line
	     after the deleted range, then the current address is set to this
	     line. Otherwise the current address is set to the line before the
	     deleted range.

     e <I>file</I>  Edit <I>file</I>, and sets the default filename.	If <I>file</I> is not speci-
	     fied, then the  default filename is used.	Any lines in the
	     buffer are deleted before the new file is read.  The current ad-

	     dress is set to the last line read.

     e <I>!command</I>
	     Edit the standard output of <I>!command</I>, (see <I>!command</I> below).  The
	     default filename is unchanged.  Any lines in the buffer are
	     deleted before the output of <I>command</I> is read.  The current ad-
	     dress is set to the last line read.

     E <I>file</I>  Edit <I>file</I> unconditionally.  This is similar to the <I>e</I> command, ex-
	     cept that unwritten changes are discarded without warning.  The
	     current address is set to the last line read.

     f <I>file</I>  Set the default filename to <I>file</I>. If <I>file</I> is not specified, then
	     the default unescaped filename is printed.

     (1,$)g/re/command-list
	     Apply <I>command-list</I> to each of the addressed lines matching a reg-
	     ular expression <I>re</I>. The current address is set to the line cur-
	     rently matched before <I>command-list</I> is executed.  At the end of
	     the <I>g</I> command, the current address is set to the last line af-
	     fected by <I>command-list</I>.

	     Each command in <I>command-list</I> must be on a separate line, and ev-
	     ery line except for the last must be terminated by a backslash
	     (\).  Any commands are allowed, except for <I>g</I>, <I>G</I>, <I>v</I>, and <I>V</I>. A new-
	     line alone in <I>command-list</I> is equivalent to a <I>p</I> command.

     (1,$)G/re/
	     Interactively edit the addressed lines matching a regular expres-
	     sion <I>re</I>. For each matching line, the line is printed, the current
	     address is set, and the user is prompted to enter a <I>command-list</I>.
	     At the end of the <I>G</I> command, the current address is set to the
	     last line affected by (the last) <I>command-list</I>.

	     The format of <I>command-list</I> is the same as that of the <I>g</I> command.
	     A newline alone acts as a null command list.  A single `&amp;' re-
	     peats the last non-null command list.

     H	     Toggle the printing of error explanations.  By default, explana-
	     tions are not printed.  It is recommended that ed scripts begin
	     with this command to aid in debugging.

     h	     Print an explanation of the last error.

     (.)i    Insert text in the buffer before the current line.  Text is en-
	     tered in input mode.  The current address is set to the last line
	     entered.

     (.,.+1)j
	     Join the addressed lines.	The addressed lines are deleted from
	     the buffer and replaced by a single line containing their joined
	     text.  The current address is set to the resultant line.

     (.)klc  Mark a line with a lower case letter <I>lc</I>. The  line can then be
	     addressed as <I>'lc</I> (i.e., a single quote followed by <I>lc</I> ) in subse-
	     quent commands.  The mark is not cleared until the line is delet-
	     ed or otherwise modified.

     (.,.)l  Print the addressed lines unambiguously.  If a single line fills
	     for than one screen (as might be the case when viewing a binary
	     file, for instance), a `--More--' prompt is printed on the last
	     line.  <B>Ed</B> waits until the RETURN key is pressed before displaying
	     the next screen.  The current address is set to the last line

	     printed.

     (.,.)m(.)
	     Move lines in the buffer.	The addressed lines are moved to after
	     the right-hand destination address, which may be the address <I>0</I>
	     (zero).  The current address is set to the last line moved.

     (.,.)n  Print the addressed lines along with their line numbers.  The
	     current address is set to the last line printed.

     (.,.)p  Print the addressed lines. The current address is set to the last
	     line printed.

     P	     Toggle the command prompt on and off.  Unless a prompt was speci-
	     fied by with command-line option <B>-p</B> <I>string</I>, the command prompt is
	     by default turned off.

     q	     Quit <B>ed</B>.

     Q	     Quit <B>ed</B> unconditionally.  This is similar to the <I>q</I> command, ex-
	     cept that unwritten changes are discarded without warning.

     ($)r <I>file</I>
	     Read <I>file</I> to after the addressed line.  If <I>file</I> is not specified,
	     then the default filename is used.  If there was no default file-
	     name prior to the command, then the default filename is set to
	     <I>file</I>. Otherwise, the default filename is unchanged.  The current
	     address is set to the last line read.

     ($)r <I>!command</I>
	     Read to after the addressed line the standard output of <I>!command</I>,
	     (see the <I>!command</I> below).	The default filename is unchanged.
	     The current address is set to the last line read.

     (.,.)s/re/replacement/

     (.,.)s/re/replacement/g

     (.,.)s/re/replacement/n
	     Replace text in the addressed lines matching a regular expression
	     <I>re</I> with <I>replacement</I>. By default, only the first match in each
	     line is replaced.	If the <I>g</I> (global) suffix is given, then every
	     match to be replaced.  The <I>n</I> suffix, where <I>n</I> is a positive num-
	     ber, causes only the <I>n</I>th match to be replaced.  It is an error if
	     no substitutions are performed on any of the addressed lines.
	     The current address is set the last line affected.

	     <I>Re</I> and <I>replacement</I> may be delimited by any character other than
	     space and newline (see the <I>s</I> command below).  If one or two of
	     the last delimiters is omitted, then the last line affected is
	     printed as though the print suffix <I>p</I> were specified.

	     An unescaped `&amp;' in <I>replacement</I> is replaced by the currently
	     matched text.  The character sequence <I>\m</I>, where <I>m</I> is a number in
	     the range [1,9], is replaced by the <I>m</I> <I>th</I> backreference expression
	     of the matched text.  If <I>replacement</I> consists of a single `%',
	     then <I>replacement</I> from the last substitution is used.  Newlines
	     may be embedded in <I>replacement</I> if they are escaped with a back-
	     slash (\).

     (.,.)s  Repeat the last substitution.  This form of the <I>s</I> command accepts
	     a count suffix <I>n</I>, or any combination of the characters <I>r</I>, <I>g</I>, and
	     <I>p</I>. If a count suffix <I>n</I> is given, then only the <I>n</I>th match is re-
	     placed.  The <I>r</I> suffix causes the regular expression of the last
	     search to be used instead of the that of the last substitution.
	     The <I>g</I> suffix toggles the global suffix of the last substitution.
	     The <I>p</I> suffix toggles the print suffix of the last substitution
	     The current address is set to the last line affected.

     (.,.)t(.)
	     Copy (i.e., transfer) the addressed lines to after the right-hand
	     destination address, which may be the address <I>0</I> (zero).  The cur-
	     rent address is set to the last line copied.

     u	     Undo the last command and restores the current address to what it
	     was before the command.  The global commands <I>g</I>, <I>G</I>, <I>v</I>, and <I>V</I>. are
	     treated as a single command by undo.  <I>u</I> is its own inverse.

     (1,$)v/re/command-list
	     Apply <I>command-list</I> to each of the addressed lines not matching a
	     regular expression <I>re</I>. This is similar to the <I>g</I> command.

     (1,$)V/re/
	     Interactively edit the addressed lines not matching a regular ex-
	     pression <I>re</I>. This is similar to the <I>G</I> command.

     (1,$)w <I>file</I>
	     Write the addressed lines to <I>file</I>. Any previous contents of <I>file</I>
	     is lost without warning.  If there is no default filename, then
	     the default filename is set to <I>file</I>, otherwise it is unchanged.
	     If no filename is specified, then the default filename is used.
	     The current address is unchanged.

     (1,$)wq <I>file</I>
	     Write the addressed lines to <I>file</I>, and then executes a <I>q</I> command.

     (1,$)w <I>!command</I>
	     Write the addressed lines to the standard input of <I>!command</I>, (see
	     the <I>!command</I> below).  The default filename and current address
	     are unchanged.

     (1,$)W <I>file</I>
	     Append the addressed lines to the end of <I>file</I>. This is similar to
	     the <I>w</I> command, expect that the previous contents of file is not
	     clobbered.  The current address is unchanged.

     x	     Prompt for an encryption key which is used in subsequent reads
	     and writes.  If a newline alone is entered as the key, then en-
	     cryption is turned off.  Otherwise, echoing is disabled while a
	     key is read.  Encryption/decryption is done using the <B><A HREF="bdes.html">bdes(1)</A></B> al-
	     gorithm.

     (.+1)zn
	     Scroll <I>n</I> lines at a time starting at addressed line.  If <I>n</I> is not
	     specified, then the current window size is used.  The current ad-
	     dress is set to the last line printed.

     !command
	     Execute <I>command</I> via <B><A HREF="sh.html">sh(1)</A></B>.  If the first character of <I>command</I> is
	     `!', then it is replaced by text of the previous <I>!command</I>. <B>Ed</B>
	     does not process <I>command</I> for backslash (\) escapes.  However, an
	     unescaped <I>%</I> is replaced by the default filename.  When the shell
	     returns from execution, a `!'  is printed to the standard output.
	     The current line is unchanged.

     ($)=    Print the line number of the addressed line.

     (.+1)newline
	     Print the addressed line, and sets the current address to that
	     line.

<H2>LIMITATIONS</H2><PRE>
     <B>Ed</B> processes <I>file</I> arguments for backslash escapes, i.e.,  in a filename,
     any characters preceded by a backslash (\) are interpreted literally.

     If a text (non-binary) file is not terminated by a newline character,
     then <B>ed</B> appends one on reading/writing it.  In the case of a binary file,
     <B>ed</B> does not append a newline on reading/writing.

     per line overhead: 4 ints


</PRE>
<H2>DIAGNOSTICS</H2><PRE>
     When an error occurs, <B>ed</B> prints a `?' and either returns to command mode
     or exits if its input is from a script.  An explanation of the last error
     can be printed with the <I>h</I> (help) command.

     Since the <I>g</I> (global) command  masks any errors from failed searches and
     substitutions, it can be used to perform conditional operations in
     scripts; e.g.,

     <B>g</B>/<I>old</I>/<B>s</B>//<I>new</I>/

     replaces any occurrences of <I>old</I> with <I>new</I>. If the <I>u</I> (undo) command occurs
     in a global command list, then the command list is executed only once.

     If diagnostics are not disabled, attempting to quit <B>ed</B> or edit another
     file before writing a modified buffer results in an error.  If the com-
     mand is entered a second time, it succeeds, but any changes to the buffer
     are lost.
