<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     IEEE Std1003.1-1988 (``POSIX'') legislates that a time_t value of
     536457599 shall correspond to "Wed Dec 31 23:59:59 GMT 1986."  This ef-
     fectively implies that POSIX time_t's cannot include leap seconds and,
     therefore, that the system time must be adjusted as each leap occurs.

     If the time package is configured with leap-second support enabled, how-
     ever, no such adjustment is needed and time_t values continue to increase
     over leap events (as a true `seconds since...' value).  This means that
     these values will differ from those required by POSIX by the net number
     of leap seconds inserted since the Epoch.

     Typically this is not a problem as the type time_t is intended to be
     (mostly) opaque--time_t values should only be obtained-from and passed-to
     functions such as <B><A HREF="time.html">time(2)</A></B>,  <B><A HREF="ctime.html">localtime(3)</A></B>,	<B><A HREF="ctime.html">mktime(3)</A></B> and <B><A HREF="ctime.html">difftime(3)</A></B>.
     However, gives an arithmetic expression for directly computing a time_t
     value from a given date/time, and the same relationship is assumed by
     some (usually older) applications.  Any programs creating/dissecting
     time_t's using such a relationship will typically not handle intervals
     over leap seconds correctly.

     The <B>time2posix</B>() and <B>posix2time</B>() functions are provided to address this
     time_t mismatch by converting between local time_t values and their POSIX
     equivalents.  This is done by accounting for the number of time-base
     changes that would have taken place on a POSIX system as leap seconds
     were inserted or deleted.	These converted values can then be used in
     lieu of correcting the older applications, or when communicating with
     POSIX-compliant systems.

     The <B>time2posix</B>() function is single-valued.  That is, every local time_t
     corresponds to a single POSIX time_t.  The <B>posix2time</B>() function is less
     well-behaved: for a positive leap second hit the result is not unique,
     and for a negative leap second hit the corresponding POSIX time_t doesn't
     exist so an adjacent value is returned.  Both of these are good indica-
     tors of the inferiority of the POSIX representation.

     The following table summarizes the relationship between time_t and its
     conversion to, and back from, the POSIX representation over the leap sec-
     ond inserted at the end of June, 1993.
     DATE     TIME     T   X=time2posix(T) posix2time(X)
     93/06/30 23:59:59 A+0 B+0		   A+0
     93/06/30 23:59:60 A+1 B+1		   A+1 or A+2
     93/07/01 00:00:00 A+2 B+1		   A+1 or A+2
     93/07/01 00:00:01 A+3 B+2		   A+3

     A leap second deletion would look like...

     DATE     TIME     T   X=time2posix(T) posix2time(X)
     ??/06/30 23:59:58 A+0 B+0		   A+0
     ??/07/01 00:00:00 A+1 B+2		   A+1
     ??/07/01 00:00:01 A+2 B+3		   A+2

	      [Note: posix2time(B+1) =&gt; A+0 or A+1]

     If leap-second support is not enabled, local time_t's and POSIX time_t's
     are equivalent, and both <B>time2posix</B>() and <B>posix2time</B>() degenerate to the
     identity function.
