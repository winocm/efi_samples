<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     <B>#include</B> <B>&lt;sys/time.h&gt;</B>

     <I>int</I>
     <B>utimes</B>(<I>const</I> <I>char</I> <I>*file</I>, <I>const</I> <I>struct</I> <I>timeval</I> <I>*times</I>)


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     The <B>utimes</B>() function sets the access and modification times of the named
     file from the structures in the argument array <I>times</I>.

     The first structure is the access time, and the second is the modifica-
     tion time.

     If the times are specified (the <I>times</I> argument is non-NULL) the caller
     must be the owner of the file or be the super-user.

     If the times are not specified (the <I>times</I> argument is NULL) the caller
     must be the owner of the file, have permission to write the file, or be
     the super-user.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUES</H2><PRE>
     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a value
     of -1 is returned and <I>errno</I> is set to indicate the error.


</PRE>
<H2>ERRORS</H2><PRE>
     <B>Utimes</B>() will fail if:

		   prefix; or the <I>times</I> argument is NULL and the effective us-
		   er ID of the process does not match the owner of the file,
		   and is not the super-user, and write access is denied.
