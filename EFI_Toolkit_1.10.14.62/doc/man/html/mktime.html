<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     The <B>mktime</B> utility is a Win32 application.  <B>mktime</B> converts a time source
     definition into a format usable by the locale-dependent functions. It is
     used to define the many ways in which locale-dependent functions output.

     It reads <I>Inputfile</I> which is a LC_TIME source file and produces a
     <I>OutputFile</I> which is a LC_TIME binary file suitable for placement in
     /etc/locale/<I>language</I>/LC_TIME.

     Options list: </PRE>
<PRE>	<I>-d</I>: used for debugging.  </PRE>
<PRE>	<I>Outputfile: its default value is </I>LC_TIME

</PRE>
<PRE>     The time source definition file is formated as belows:

     The 1 - 12 valid lines are national representation of abbreviated month
     names.

     The 13 - 24 valid lines are national representation of full month names.

     The 25 - 31 valid lines are national representation of abbreviated week-
     day names.

     The 32 - 38 valid lines are national representation of full weekday
     names.

     The 39 valid line is X_fmt string.

     The 40 valid line is x_fmt string.

     The 41 valid line is c_fmt string.

     The 42 valid line is abbreviation morning string.

     The 43 valid line is abbreviation afternoon string.

     The 44 valid line is date_fmt string.

</PRE>
<PRE>     X_fmt string is used for national representation of the time.

     x_fmt string is used for national representation of the date.

     c_fmt string is used for national representation of time and date (the
     format is similar with produced by <B>asctime(3)</B>.

</PRE>
<PRE>     The format characters in those format strings can be:</PRE>
<PRE>
          %a    is replaced by national representation of the abbreviated
     weekday name, where the abbreviation is the first three charac-
     ters.


          %B    is replaced by national representation of the full month name.

          %b    is replaced by national representation of the abbreviated
     month name, where the abbreviation is the first three characters.

          %C    is replaced by (year / 100) as decimal number; single digits
     are preceded by a zero.

          %D    is equivalent to ``%m/%d/%y''.

     (01-31).

          %e    is replaced by the day of month as a decimal number (1-31);

     year is the one that contains the greater part of the week (Mon-
     day as the first day of the week).

          %g    is replaced by the same year as in ``%G'', but as a decimal
     number without century (00-99).

          %H    is replaced by the hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number
     (00-23).

          %h    the same as %b.

          %I    is replaced by the hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number
     (01-12).

          %k    is replaced by the hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number
     (0-23); single digits are preceded by a blank.

          %l    is replaced by the hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number
     (1-12); single digits are preceded by a blank.

          %M    is replaced by the minute as a decimal number (00-59).

          %m    is replaced by the month as a decimal number (01-12).

          %n    is replaced by a newline.

          %S    is replaced by the second as a decimal number (00-60).

          %s    is replaced by the number of seconds since the Epoch, UTC (
     <B>mktime(3)</B>).

          %T    is equivalent to ``%H:%M:%S''.

          %t    is replaced by a tab.

          %U    is replaced by the week number of the year (Sunday as the

          %u    is replaced by the weekday (Monday as the first day of the
     week) as a decimal number (1-7).

          %V    is replaced by the week number of the year (Monday as the
     first day of the week) as a decimal number (01-53).  If the week
     containing January 1 has four or more days in the new year, then
     it is week 1; otherwise it is the last week of the previous year,
     and the next week is week 1.

          %v    is equivalent to ``%e-%b-%Y''.

          %W    is replaced by the week number of the year (Monday as the
     first day of the week) as a decimal number (00-53).

          %w    is replaced by the weekday (Sunday as the first day of the
     week) as a decimal number (0-6).

          %Y    is replaced by the year with century as a decimal number.

          %y    is replaced by the year without century as a decimal number
    (00-99).

          %Z    is replaced by the time zone name.

          %z    is replaced by the time zone offset from UTC; a leading plus
     sign stands for east of UTC, a minus sign for west of UTC, hours
     and minutes follow with two digits each and no delimiter between
     them (common form for RFC 822 date headers).

          %%    is replaced by `%'.
