</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <B>ftp</B> is the user interface to the ARPANET standard File Transfer Protocol.
     The program allows a user to transfer files to and from a remote network
     site.

     The latter three usage formats will fetch a file using either the HTTP or
     FTP protocols into the current directory.	This is ideal for scripts.
     Refer to <I>AUTO-FETCHING</I> <I>FILES</I> below for more information.

     Options may be specified at the command line, or to the command inter-
     preter.

     <B>-a</B>        Causes <B>ftp</B> to bypass normal login procedure, and use an anony-
	       mous login instead.

     <B>-d</B>        Enables debugging.

     <B>-e</B>        Disables command line editing.

     <B>-g</B>        Disables file name globbing.

     <B>-U</B>        Disable data port range restrictions.

     <B>-i</B>        Turns off interactive prompting during multiple file transfers.

     <B>-n</B>        Restrains <B>ftp</B> from attempting ``auto-login'' upon initial con-
	       nection.  If auto-login is enabled, <B>ftp</B> will check the <I>.netrc</I>
	       (see below) file in the user's home directory for an entry de-
	       scribing an account on the remote machine.  If no entry exists,
	       <B>ftp</B> will prompt for the remote machine login name (default is
	       the user identity on the local machine), and, if necessary,
	       prompt for a password and an account with which to login.

     <B>-p</B>        Enable passive mode operation for use behind connection filter-
	       ing firewalls.  Using the <B>pftp</B> command has the same effect.

     <B>-P</B> <I>port</I>   Sets the port number to <I>port</I>.

     <B>-t</B>        Enables packet tracing.

     <B>-v</B>        Enable verbose mode.  This is the default if input is from a
	       terminal.  Forces <B>ftp</B> to show all responses from the remote
	       server, as well as report on data transfer statistics.

     <B>-V</B>        Disable verbose mode, overriding the default of enabled when
	       input is from a terminal.

     The client host with which <B>ftp</B> is to communicate may be specified on the
     command line.  If this is done, <B>ftp</B> will immediately attempt to establish
     a connection to an FTP server on that host; otherwise, <B>ftp</B> will enter its
     command interpreter and await instructions from the user.	When <B>ftp</B> is
     awaiting commands from the user the prompt `ftp&gt;' is provided to the us-

     er.  The following commands are recognized by <B>ftp</B>:

     <B>!</B> [<I>command</I> [<I>args</I>]]
		 Invoke an interactive shell on the local machine.  If there
		 are arguments, the first is taken to be a command to execute
		 directly, with the rest of the arguments as its arguments.

     <B>$</B> <I>macro-name</I> [<I>args</I>]
		 Execute the macro <I>macro-name</I> that was defined with the <B>macdef</B>
		 command.  Arguments are passed to the macro unglobbed.

     <B>account</B> [<I>passwd</I>]
		 Supply a supplemental password required by a remote system
		 for access to resources once a login has been successfully
		 completed.  If no argument is included, the user will be
		 prompted for an account password in a non-echoing input mode.

     <B>append</B> <I>local-file</I> [<I>remote-file</I>]
		 Append a local file to a file on the remote machine.  If
		 <I>remote-file</I> is left unspecified, the local file name is used
		 in naming the remote file after being altered by any <B>ntrans</B>
		 or <B>nmap</B> setting.  File transfer uses the current settings for
		 <B>type</B>, <B>format</B>, <B>mode</B>, and <B>structure</B>.

     <B>ascii</B>	 Set the file transfer <B>type</B> to network ASCII. This is the de-
		 fault type.

     <B>bell</B>	 Arrange that a bell be sounded after each file transfer com-
		 mand is completed.

     <B>binary</B>	 Set the file transfer <B>type</B> to support binary image transfer.

     <B>bye</B>	 Terminate the FTP session with the remote server and exit
		 <B>ftp</B>. An end of file will also terminate the session and exit.

     <B>case</B>	 Toggle remote computer file name case mapping during <B>mget</B>
		 commands.  When <B>case</B> is on (default is off), remote computer
		 file names with all letters in upper case are written in the
		 local directory with the letters mapped to lower case.

     <B>cd</B> <I>remote-directory</I>
		 Change the working directory on the remote machine to <I>remote-</I>
		 <I>directory</I>.

     <B>cdup</B>	 Change the remote machine working directory to the parent of
		 the current remote machine working directory.

     <B>chmod</B> <I>mode</I> <I>file-name</I>
		 Change the permission modes of the file <I>file-name</I> on the re-
		 mote system to <I>mode</I>.

     <B>close</B>	 Terminate the FTP session with the remote server, and return
		 to the command interpreter.  Any defined macros are erased.

     <B>cr</B> 	 Toggle carriage return stripping during ascii type file re-
		 trieval.  Records are denoted by a carriage return/linefeed
		 sequence during ascii type file transfer.  When <B>cr</B> is on (the
		 default), carriage returns are stripped from this sequence to
		 conform with the UNIX single linefeed record delimiter.
		 Records on non-UNIX remote systems may contain single line-
		 feeds; when an ascii type transfer is made, these linefeeds
		 may be distinguished from a record delimiter only when <B>cr</B> is
		 off.

     <B>delete</B> <I>remote-file</I>

		 Delete the file <I>remote-file</I> on the remote machine.

     <B>debug</B> [<I>debug-value</I>]
		 Toggle debugging mode.  If an optional <I>debug-value</I> is speci-
		 fied it is used to set the debugging level.  When debugging
		 is on, <B>ftp</B> prints each command sent to the remote machine,
		 preceded by the string `--&gt;'

     <B>dir</B> [<I>remote-directory</I> [<I>local-file</I>]]
		 Print a listing of the contents of a directory on the remote
		 machine.  The listing includes any system-dependent informa-
		 tion that the server chooses to include; for example, most
		 UNIX systems will produce output from the command `ls -l'.
		 (See also <B>ls</B>.) If <I>remote-directory</I> is left unspecified, the
		 current working directory is used.  If interactive prompting
		 is on, <B>ftp</B> will prompt the user to verify that the last argu-
		 ment is indeed the target local file for receiving <B>dir</B> out-
		 put.  If no local file is specified, or if <I>local-file</I> is `<B>-</B>',
		 the output is sent to the terminal.

     <B>disconnect</B>  A synonym for <B>close</B>.

     <B>edit</B>	 Toggle command line editing, and context sensitive command
		 and file completion.  This is automatically enabled if input
		 is from a terminal, and disabled otherwise.

     <B>exit</B>	 A synonym for <B>bye</B>.

     <B>ftp</B> <I>host</I> [<I>port</I>]
		 A synonym for <B>open</B>.

     <B>form</B> <I>format</I>
		 Set the file transfer <B>form</B> to <I>format</I>. The default format is
		 ``file''.

     <B>get</B> <I>remote-file</I> [<I>local-file</I>]
		 Retrieve the <I>remote-file</I> and store it on the local machine.
		 If the local file name is not specified, it is given the same
		 name it has on the remote machine, subject to alteration by
		 the current <B>case</B>, <B>ntrans</B>, and <B>nmap</B> settings.  The current
		 settings for <B>type</B>, <B>form</B>, <B>mode</B>, and <B>structure</B> are used while
		 transferring the file.

     <B>gate</B> [<I>host</I> [<I>port</I>]]
		 Toggle gate-ftp mode.	This will not be permitted if the
		 gate-ftp server hasn't been set (either explicitly by the us-
		 er, or from the FTPSERVER environment variable).  If <I>host</I> is
		 given, then gate-ftp mode will be enabled, and the gate-ftp
		 server will be set to <I>host</I>. If <I>port</I> is also given, that will
		 be used as the port to connect to on the gate-ftp server.

     <B>glob</B>	 Toggle filename expansion for <B>mdelete</B>, <B>mget</B> and <B>mput</B>. If
		 globbing is turned off with <B>glob</B>, the file name arguments are
		 taken literally and not expanded.  Globbing for <B>mput</B> is done
		 as in <B><A HREF="csh.html">csh(1)</A></B>.	For <B>mdelete</B> and <B>mget</B>, each remote file name is
		 expanded separately on the remote machine and the lists are
		 not merged.  Expansion of a directory name is likely to be
		 different from expansion of the name of an ordinary file: the
		 exact result depends on the foreign operating system and ftp
		 server, and can be previewed by doing `mls remote-files -'
		 Note: <B>mget</B> and <B>mput</B> are not meant to transfer entire directo-
		 ry subtrees of files.	That can be done by transferring a
		 <B><A HREF="tar.html">tar(1)</A></B> archive of the subtree (in binary mode).

     <B>hash</B> [<I>size</I>]
		 Toggle hash-sign (``#'') printing for each data block trans-
		 ferred.  The size of a data block defaults to 1024 bytes.
		 This can be changed by specifying <I>size</I> in bytes.

     <B>help</B> [<I>command</I>]
		 Print an informative message about the meaning of <I>command</I>. If
		 no argument is given, <B>ftp</B> prints a list of the known com-
		 mands.

     <B>idle</B> [<I>seconds</I>]
		 Set the inactivity timer on the remote server to <I>seconds</I> sec-
		 onds.	If <I>seconds</I> is omitted, the current inactivity timer is
		 printed.

     <B>lcd</B> [<I>directory</I>]
		 Change the working directory on the local machine.  If no
		 <I>directory</I> is specified, the user's home directory is used.

     <B>less</B> <I>file</I>	 A synonym for <B>page</B>.

     <B>lpwd</B>	 Print the working directory on the local machine.

     <B>ls</B> [<I>remote-directory</I> [<I>local-file</I>]]
		 Print a list of the files in a directory on the remote ma-
		 chine.  If <I>remote-directory</I> is left unspecified, the current
		 working directory is used.  If interactive prompting is on,
		 <B>ftp</B> will prompt the user to verify that the last argument is
		 indeed the target local file for receiving <B>ls</B> output.	If no
		 local file is specified, or if <I>local-file</I> is <B>-</B>, the output is
		 sent to the terminal.

     <B>macdef</B> <I>macro-name</I>
		 Define a macro.  Subsequent lines are stored as the macro
		 <I>macro-name</I>; a null line (consecutive newline characters in a
		 file or carriage returns from the terminal) terminates macro
		 input mode.  There is a limit of 16 macros and 4096 total
		 characters in all defined macros.  Macros remain defined un-
		 til a <B>close</B> command is executed.  The macro processor inter-
		 prets `$' and `\' as special characters.  A `$' followed by a
		 number (or numbers) is replaced by the corresponding argument
		 on the macro invocation command line.	A `$' followed by an
		 `i' signals that macro processor that the executing macro is
		 to be looped.	On the first pass `$i' is replaced by the
		 first argument on the macro invocation command line, on the
		 second pass it is replaced by the second argument, and so on.
		 A `\' followed by any character is replaced by that charac-
		 ter.  Use the `\' to prevent special treatment of the `$'.

     <B>mdelete</B> [<I>remote-files</I>]
		 Delete the <I>remote-files</I> on the remote machine.

     <B>mdir</B> <I>remote-files</I> <I>local-file</I>
		 Like <B>dir</B>, except multiple remote files may be specified.  If
		 interactive prompting is on, <B>ftp</B> will prompt the user to ver-
		 ify that the last argument is indeed the target local file
		 for receiving <B>mdir</B> output.

     <B>mget</B> <I>remote-files</I>
		 Expand the <I>remote-files</I> on the remote machine and do a <B>get</B>
		 for each file name thus produced.  See <B>glob</B> for details on
		 the filename expansion.  Resulting file names will then be
		 processed according to <B>case</B>, <B>ntrans</B>, and <B>nmap</B> settings.
		 Files are transferred into the local working directory, which
		 can be changed with `lcd directory'; new local directories

		 can be created with `! mkdir directory'.

     <B>mkdir</B> <I>directory-name</I>
		 Make a directory on the remote machine.

     <B>mls</B> <I>remote-files</I> <I>local-file</I>
		 Like <B>ls</B>, except multiple remote files may be specified, and
		 the <I>local-file</I> must be specified.  If interactive prompting
		 is on, <B>ftp</B> will prompt the user to verify that the last argu-
		 ment is indeed the target local file for receiving <B>mls</B> out-
		 put.

     <B>mode</B> [<I>mode-name</I>]
		 Set the file transfer <B>mode</B> to <I>mode-name</I>. The default mode is
		 ``stream'' mode.

     <B>modtime</B> <I>file-name</I>
		 Show the last modification time of the file on the remote ma-
		 chine.

     <B>more</B> <I>file</I>	 A synonym for <B>page</B>.

     <B>mput</B> <I>local-files</I>
		 Expand wild cards in the list of local files given as argu-
		 ments and do a <B>put</B> for each file in the resulting list.  See
		 <B>glob</B> for details of filename expansion.  Resulting file names
		 will then be processed according to <B>ntrans</B> and <B>nmap</B> settings.

     <B>msend</B> <I>local-files</I>
		 A synonym for <B>mput</B>.

     <B>newer</B> <I>file-name</I>
		 Get the file only if the modification time of the remote file
		 is more recent that the file on the current system.  If the
		 file does not exist on the current system, the remote file is
		 considered <B>newer</B>. Otherwise, this command is identical to
		 <I>get</I>.

     <B>nlist</B> [<I>remote-directory</I> [<I>local-file</I>]]
		 A synonym for <B>ls</B>.

     <B>nmap</B> [<I>inpattern</I> <I>outpattern</I>]
		 Set or unset the filename mapping mechanism.  If no arguments
		 are specified, the filename mapping mechanism is unset.  If
		 arguments are specified, remote filenames are mapped during
		 <B>mput</B> commands and <B>put</B> commands issued without a specified re-
		 mote target filename.	If arguments are specified, local
		 filenames are mapped during <B>mget</B> commands and <B>get</B> commands
		 issued without a specified local target filename.  This com-
		 mand is useful when connecting to a non-UNIX remote computer
		 with different file naming conventions or practices.  The
		 mapping follows the pattern set by <I>inpattern</I> and <I>outpattern</I>.
		 [<I>Inpattern</I>] is a template for incoming filenames (which may
		 have already been processed according to the <B>ntrans</B> and <B>case</B>
		 settings).  Variable templating is accomplished by including
		 the sequences `$1', `$2', ..., `$9' in <I>inpattern</I>. Use `\' to
		 prevent this special treatment of the `$' character.  All
		 other characters are treated literally, and are used to de-
		 termine the <B>nmap</B> [<I>inpattern</I>] variable values.	For example,
		 given <I>inpattern</I> $1.$2 and the remote file name "mydata.data",
		 $1 would have the value "mydata", and $2 would have the value
		 "data".  The <I>outpattern</I> determines the resulting mapped file-
		 name.	The sequences `$1', `$2', ...., `$9' are replaced by
		 any value resulting from the <I>inpattern</I> template.  The se-
		 quence `$0' is replace by the original filename.  Additional-
		 ly, the sequence `[<I>seq1</I>, <I>seq2</I>]' is replaced by [<I>seq1</I>] if <I>seq1</I>
		 is not a null string; otherwise it is replaced by <I>seq2</I>. For
		 example, the command

		       nmap $1.$2.$3 [$1,$2].[$2,file]

		 would yield the output filename "myfile.data" for input file-
		 names "myfile.data" and "myfile.data.old", "myfile.file" for
		 the input filename "myfile", and "myfile.myfile" for the in-
		 put filename ".myfile".  Spaces may be included in
		 <I>outpattern</I>, as in the example: `nmap $1 sed "s/  *$//" &gt; $1'
		 .  Use the `\' character to prevent special treatment of the
		 `$','[',']', and `,' characters.

     <B>ntrans</B> [<I>inchars</I> [<I>outchars</I>]]
		 Set or unset the filename character translation mechanism.
		 If no arguments are specified, the filename character trans-
		 lation mechanism is unset.  If arguments are specified, char-
		 acters in remote filenames are translated during <B>mput</B> com-
		 mands and <B>put</B> commands issued without a specified remote tar-
		 get filename.	If arguments are specified, characters in lo-
		 cal filenames are translated during <B>mget</B> commands and <B>get</B>
		 commands issued without a specified local target filename.
		 This command is useful when connecting to a non-UNIX remote
		 computer with different file naming conventions or practices.
		 Characters in a filename matching a character in <I>inchars</I> are
		 replaced with the corresponding character in <I>outchars</I>. If the
		 character's position in <I>inchars</I> is longer than the length of
		 <I>outchars</I>, the character is deleted from the file name.

     <B>open</B> <I>host</I> [<I>port</I>]
		 Establish a connection to the specified <I>host</I> FTP server.  An
		 optional port number may be supplied, in which case, <B>ftp</B> will
		 attempt to contact an FTP server at that port.  If the <B>auto-</B>
		 <B>login</B> option is on (default), <B>ftp</B> will also attempt to auto-
		 matically log the user in to the FTP server (see below).

     <B>page</B> <I>file</I>	 Retrieve <B>file</B> and display with the program defined in PAGER
		 (which defaults to <B><A HREF="less.html">less(1)</A></B>).

     <B>passive</B>	 Toggle passive mode.  If passive mode is turned on (default
		 is off), the ftp client will send a PASV command for all data
		 connections instead of the usual PORT command.  The PASV com-
		 mand requests that the remote server open a port for the data
		 connection and return the address of that port.  The remote
		 server listens on that port and the client connects to it.
		 When using the more traditional PORT command, the client lis-
		 tens on a port and sends that address to the remote server,
		 who connects back to it.  Passive mode is useful when using
		 <B>ftp</B> through a gateway router or host that controls the direc-
		 tionality of traffic.	(Note that though ftp servers are re-
		 quired to support the PASV command by RFC 1123, some do not.)

     <B>preserve</B>	 Toggle preservation of modification times on retrieved files.

     <B>progress</B>	 Toggle display of transfer progress bar.  The progress bar
		 will be disabled for a transfer that has <I>local-file</I> as `<B>-</B>' or
		 a command that starts with `|'. Refer to <I>FILE</I> <I>NAMING</I>
		 <I>CONVENTIONS</I> for more information.

     <B>prompt</B>	 Toggle interactive prompting.	Interactive prompting occurs
		 during multiple file transfers to allow the user to selec-
		 tively retrieve or store files.  If prompting is turned off
		 (default is on), any <B>mget</B> or <B>mput</B> will transfer all files,
		 and any <B>mdelete</B> will delete all files.

		 When prompting is on, the following commands are available at
		 a prompt:

		       <B>n</B>   Do not transfer the file.

		       <B>a</B>   Answer `yes' to the current file, and automatically
			   answer `yes' to any remaining files for the current
			   command.

		       <B>p</B>   Answer `yes' to the current file, and turn off
			   prompt mode (as if ``prompt off'' had been given).

		 Any other reponse will answer `yes' to the current file.

     <B>proxy</B> <I>ftp-command</I>
		 Execute an ftp command on a secondary control connection.
		 This command allows simultaneous connection to two remote ftp
		 servers for transferring files between the two servers.  The
		 first <B>proxy</B> command should be an <B>open</B>, to establish the sec-
		 ondary control connection.  Enter the command "proxy ?" to
		 see other ftp commands executable on the secondary connec-
		 tion.	The following commands behave differently when pref-
		 aced by <B>proxy</B>: <B>open</B> will not define new macros during the au-
		 to-login process, <B>close</B> will not erase existing macro defini-
		 tions, <B>get</B> and <B>mget</B> transfer files from the host on the pri-
		 mary control connection to the host on the secondary control
		 connection, and <B>put</B>, <B>mput</B>, and <B>append</B> transfer files from the
		 host on the secondary control connection to the host on the
		 primary control connection.  Third party file transfers de-
		 pend upon support of the ftp protocol PASV command by the
		 server on the secondary control connection.

     <B>put</B> <I>local-file</I> [<I>remote-file</I>]
		 Store a local file on the remote machine.  If <I>remote-file</I> is
		 left unspecified, the local file name is used after process-
		 ing according to any <B>ntrans</B> or <B>nmap</B> settings in naming the
		 remote file.  File transfer uses the current settings for
		 <B>type</B>, <B>format</B>, <B>mode</B>, and <B>structure</B>.

     <B>pwd</B>	 Print the name of the current working directory on the remote
		 machine.

     <B>quit</B>	 A synonym for <B>bye</B>.

     <B>quote</B> <I>arg1</I> <I>arg2</I> <I>...</I>
		 The arguments specified are sent, verbatim, to the remote FTP
		 server.

     <B>recv</B> <I>remote-file</I> [<I>local-file</I>]
		 A synonym for <B>get</B>.

     <B>reget</B> <I>remote-file</I> [<I>local-file</I>]
		 Reget acts like get, except that if <I>local-file</I> exists and is
		 smaller than <I>remote-file</I>, <I>local-file</I> is presumed to be a par-
		 tially transferred copy of <I>remote-file</I> and the transfer is
		 continued from the apparent point of failure.	This command
		 is useful when transferring very large files over networks
		 that are prone to dropping connections.

     <B>remotehelp</B> [<I>command-name</I>]
		 Request help from the remote FTP server.  If a <I>command-name</I>
		 is specified it is supplied to the server as well.

     <B>rstatus</B> [<I>file-name</I>]
		 With no arguments, show status of remote machine.  If <I>file-</I>
		 <I>name</I> is specified, show status of <I>file-name</I> on remote ma-

		 chine.

     <B>rename</B> [<I>from</I> [<I>to</I>]]
		 Rename the file <I>from</I> on the remote machine, to the file <I>to</I>.

     <B>reset</B>	 Clear reply queue.  This command re-synchronizes command/re-
		 ply sequencing with the remote ftp server.  Resynchronization
		 may be necessary following a violation of the ftp protocol by
		 the remote server.

     <B>restart</B> <I>marker</I>
		 Restart the immediately following <B>get</B> or <B>put</B> at the indicated
		 <I>marker</I>. On UNIX systems, marker is usually a byte offset into
		 the file.

     <B>restrict</B>	 Toggle data port range restrictions.  When not operating in
		 passive mode,	the <B>ftp</B> client program requests that the re-
		 mote server open a connection back to the client host on a
		 separate data port.  In previous versions, that remote port
		 fell in the range 1024..4999.	However, most firewall setups
		 filter that range of TCP ports because other services reside
		 there.  The default behavior now is for the client to request
		 that the server connect back to the client using the port
		 range 40000..44999.  Firewall administrators can chose to al-
		 low TCP connections in that range, if they deem it to not be
		 a security risk.

     <B>rmdir</B> <I>directory-name</I>
		 Delete a directory on the remote machine.

     <B>runique</B>	 Toggle storing of files on the local system with unique file-
		 names.  If a file already exists with a name equal to the
		 target local filename for a <B>get</B> or <B>mget</B> command, a ".1" is
		 appended to the name.	If the resulting name matches another
		 existing file, a ".2" is appended to the original name.  If
		 this process continues up to ".99", an error message is
		 printed, and the transfer does not take place.  The generated
		 unique filename will be reported.  Note that <B>runique</B> will not
		 affect local files generated from a shell command (see be-
		 low).	The default value is off.

     <B>send</B> <I>local-file</I> [<I>remote-file</I>]
		 A synonym for <B>put</B>.

     <B>sendport</B>	 Toggle the use of PORT commands.  By default, <B>ftp</B> will at-
		 tempt to use a PORT command when establishing a connection
		 for each data transfer.  The use of PORT commands can prevent
		 delays when performing multiple file transfers.  If the PORT
		 command fails, <B>ftp</B> will use the default data port.  When the
		 use of PORT commands is disabled, no attempt will be made to
		 use PORT commands for each data transfer.  This is useful for
		 certain FTP implementations which do ignore PORT commands
		 but, incorrectly, indicate they've been accepted.

     <B>site</B> <I>arg1</I> <I>arg2</I> <I>...</I>
		 The arguments specified are sent, verbatim, to the remote FTP
		 server as a SITE command.

     <B>size</B> <I>file-name</I>
		 Return size of <I>file-name</I> on remote machine.

     <B>status</B>	 Show the current status of <B>ftp</B>.

     <B>struct</B> [<I>struct-name</I>]
		 Set the file transfer <I>structure</I> to <I>struct-name</I>. By default

		 ``stream'' structure is used.

     <B>sunique</B>	 Toggle storing of files on remote machine under unique file
		 names.  Remote ftp server must support ftp protocol STOU com-
		 mand for successful completion.  The remote server will re-
		 port unique name.  Default value is off.

     <B>system</B>	 Show the type of operating system running on the remote ma-
		 chine.

     <B>tenex</B>	 Set the file transfer type to that needed to talk to TENEX
		 machines.

     <B>trace</B>	 Toggle packet tracing.

     <B>type</B> [<I>type-name</I>]
		 Set the file transfer <B>type</B> to <I>type-name</I>. If no type is speci-
		 fied, the current type is printed.  The default type is net-
		 work ASCII.

     <B>umask</B> [<I>newmask</I>]
		 Set the default umask on the remote server to <I>newmask</I>. If
		 <I>newmask</I> is omitted, the current umask is printed.

     <B>user</B> <I>user-name</I> [<I>password</I> [<I>account</I>]]
		 Identify yourself to the remote FTP server.  If the <I>password</I>
		 is not specified and the server requires it, <B>ftp</B> will prompt
		 the user for it (after disabling local echo).	If an <I>account</I>
		 field is not specified, and the FTP server requires it, the
		 user will be prompted for it.	If an <I>account</I> field is speci-
		 fied, an account command will be relayed to the remote server
		 after the login sequence is completed if the remote server
		 did not require it for logging in.  Unless <B>ftp</B> is invoked
		 with ``auto-login'' disabled, this process is done automati-
		 cally on initial connection to the FTP server.

     <B>verbose</B>	 Toggle verbose mode.  In verbose mode, all responses from the
		 FTP server are displayed to the user.	In addition, if ver-
		 bose is on, when a file transfer completes, statistics re-
		 garding the efficiency of the transfer are reported.  By de-
		 fault, verbose is on.

     <B>?</B> [<I>command</I>]
		 A synonym for <B>help</B>.

     Command arguments which have embedded spaces may be quoted with quote `"'
     marks.

     Commands which toggle settings can take an explicit <B>on</B> or <B>off</B> argument to
     force the setting appropriately.

     If <B>ftp</B> receives a SIGINFO (see the ``status'' argument of <B><A HREF="stty.html">stty(1)</A></B>)  sig-
     nal whilst a transfer is in progress, the current transfer rate statis-
     tics will be written to the standard error output, in the same format as
     the standard completion message.


</PRE>
<H2>AUTO-FETCHING FILES</H2><PRE>
     In addition to standard commands, this version of <B>ftp</B> supports an auto-
     fetch feature.  To enable auto-fetch, simply pass the list of host-
     names/files on the command line.

     The following formats are valid syntax for an auto-fetch element:

     host:/file  ``Classic'' ftp format

     ftp://[user:password@]host[:port]/file
		 An ftp URL, retrieved using the ftp protocol if ftp_proxy
		 isn't defined.  Otherwise, transfer using http via the proxy
		 defined in ftp_proxy. If <I>user:password@</I> is given and
		 ftp_proxy isn't defined, login as <I>user</I> with a password of
		 <I>password</I>.

     http://host[:port]/file
		 An HTTP URL, retrieved using the http protocol.  If
		 http_proxy is defined, it is used as a URL to an HTTP proxy
		 server.

     If a classic format or a ftp URL format has a trailing `/', then <B>ftp</B> will
     connect to the site and <B>cd</B> to the directory given as the path, and leave
     the user in interactive mode ready for further input.

     If successive auto-fetch ftp elements refer to the same host, then the
     connection is maintained between transfers, reducing overhead on connec-
     tion creation and deletion.

     If <B>file</B> contains a glob character and globbing is enabled, (see <B>glob</B>),
     then the equivalent of <B>mget</B> <B>file</B> is performed.

     If the directory component of <B>file</B> contains no globbing characters, it is
     stored in the current directory as the <B><A HREF="basename.html">basename(1)</A></B> of <B>file</B>. Otherwise,
     the remote name is used as the local name.


</PRE>
<H2>ABORTING A FILE TRANSFER</H2><PRE>
     To abort a file transfer, use the terminal interrupt key (usually Ctrl-
     C).  Sending transfers will be immediately halted.  Receiving transfers
     will be halted by sending a ftp protocol ABOR command to the remote serv-
     er, and discarding any further data received.  The speed at which this is
     accomplished depends upon the remote server's support for ABOR process-
     ing.  If the remote server does not support the ABOR command, an `ftp&gt;'
     prompt will not appear until the remote server has completed sending the
     requested file.

     The terminal interrupt key sequence will be ignored when <B>ftp</B> has complet-
     ed any local processing and is awaiting a reply from the remote server.
     A long delay in this mode may result from the ABOR processing described
     above, or from unexpected behavior by the remote server, including viola-
     tions of the ftp protocol.  If the delay results from unexpected remote
     server behavior, the local <B>ftp</B> program must be killed by hand.


</PRE>
<H2>FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS</H2><PRE>
     Files specified as arguments to <B>ftp</B> commands are processed according to
     the following rules.

     1.   If the file name `<B>-</B>' is specified, the <I>stdin</I> (for reading) or <I>stdout</I>
	  (for writing) is used.

     2.   If the first character of the file name is `|', the remainder of the
	  argument is interpreted as a shell command.  <B>ftp</B> then forks a shell,
	  using <B><A HREF="popen.html">popen(3)</A></B> with the argument supplied, and reads (writes) from
	  the stdin (stdout).  If the shell command includes spaces, the argu-
	  ment must be quoted; e.g.  ``" ls -lt"''.  A particularly useful ex-
	  ample of this mechanism is: ``dir |more''.

     3.   Failing the above checks, if ``globbing'' is enabled, local file
	  names are expanded according to the rules used in the <B><A HREF="csh.html">csh(1)</A></B>;  c.f.
	  the <B>glob</B> command.  If the <B>ftp</B> command expects a single local file
	  (.e.g.  <B>put</B>), only the first filename generated by the "globbing"

	  operation is used.

     4.   For <B>mget</B> commands and <B>get</B> commands with unspecified local file
	  names, the local filename is the remote filename, which may be al-
	  tered by a <B>case</B>, <B>ntrans</B>, or <B>nmap</B> setting.  The resulting filename
	  may then be altered if <B>runique</B> is on.

     5.   For <B>mput</B> commands and <B>put</B> commands with unspecified remote file
	  names, the remote filename is the local filename, which may be al-
	  tered by a <B>ntrans</B> or <B>nmap</B> setting.  The resulting filename may then
	  be altered by the remote server if <B>sunique</B> is on.


</PRE>
<H2>FILE TRANSFER PARAMETERS</H2><PRE>
     The FTP specification specifies many parameters which may affect a file
     transfer.	The <B>type</B> may be one of ``ascii'', ``image'' (binary),
     ``ebcdic'', and ``local byte size'' (for PDP-10's and PDP-20's mostly).
     <B>ftp</B> supports the ascii and image types of file transfer, plus local byte
     size 8 for <B>tenex</B> mode transfers.

     <B>ftp</B> supports only the default values for the remaining file transfer pa-
     rameters: <B>mode</B>, <B>form</B>, and <B>struct</B>.


</PRE>
<H2>THE .netrc FILE</H2><PRE>
     The <I>.netrc</I> file contains login and initialization information used by the
     auto-login process.  It resides in the user's home directory.  The fol-
     lowing tokens are recognized; they may be separated by spaces, tabs, or
     new-lines:

     <B>machine</B> <I>name</I>
	       Identify a remote machine <I>name</I>. The auto-login process searches
	       the <I>.netrc</I> file for a <B>machine</B> token that matches the remote ma-
	       chine specified on the <B>ftp</B> command line or as an <B>open</B> command
	       argument.  Once a match is made, the subsequent <I>.netrc</I> tokens
	       are processed, stopping when the end of file is reached or an-
	       other <B>machine</B> or a <B>default</B> token is encountered.

     <B>default</B>   This is the same as <B>machine</B> <I>name</I> except that <B>default</B> matches
	       any name.  There can be only one <B>default</B> token, and it must be
	       after all <B>machine</B> tokens.  This is normally used as:

		     default login anonymous password user@site

	       thereby giving the user <I>automatic</I> anonymous ftp login to ma-
	       chines not specified in <I>.netrc</I>. This can be overridden by using
	       the <B>-n</B> flag to disable auto-login.

     <B>login</B> <I>name</I>
	       Identify a user on the remote machine.  If this token is pre-
	       sent, the auto-login process will initiate a login using the
	       specified <I>name</I>.

     <B>password</B> <I>string</I>
	       Supply a password.  If this token is present, the auto-login
	       process will supply the specified string if the remote server
	       requires a password as part of the login process.  Note that if
	       this token is present in the <I>.netrc</I> file for any user other
	       than <I>anonymous</I>, <B>ftp</B> will abort the auto-login process if the
	       <I>.netrc</I> is readable by anyone besides the user.

     <B>account</B> <I>string</I>
	       Supply an additional account password.  If this token is pre-
	       sent, the auto-login process will supply the specified string
	       if the remote server requires an additional account password,
	       or the auto-login process will initiate an ACCT command if it

	       does not.

     <B>macdef</B> <I>name</I>
	       Define a macro.	This token functions like the <B>ftp</B> <B>macdef</B> com-
	       mand functions.	A macro is defined with the specified name;
	       its contents begin with the next <I>.netrc</I> line and continue until
	       a null line (consecutive new-line characters) is encountered.
	       If a macro named <B>init</B> is defined, it is automatically executed
	       as the last step in the auto-login process.


</PRE>
<H2>COMMAND LINE EDITING</H2><PRE>
     <B>ftp</B> supports interactive command line editing, via the <B><A HREF="editline.html">editline(3)</A></B> li-
     brary.  It is enabled with the <B>edit</B> command, and is enabled by default if
     input is from a tty.  Previous lines can be recalled and edited with the
     arrow keys, and other GNU Emacs-style editing keys may be used as well.

     The <B><A HREF="editline.html">editline(3)</A></B> library is configured with a <I>.editrc</I> file - refer to ed-
     <B><A HREF="itrc.html">itrc(5)</A></B> for more information.

     An extra key binding is available to <B>ftp</B> to provide context sensitive
     command and filename completion (including remote file completion).  To
     use this, bind a key to the <B><A HREF="editline.html">editline(3)</A></B> command <B>ftp-complete</B>. By default,
     this is bound to the TAB key.


</PRE>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2><PRE>
     <B>ftp</B> utilizes the following environment variables.

     FTP_PASSIVE_MODE  Use passive mode FTP by default.

     FTPSERVER	       Host to use as gate-ftp server when <B>gate</B> is enabled.

     FTPSERVERPORT     Port to use when connecting to gate-ftp server when
		       <B>gate</B> is enabled.  Default is port returned by a
		       <B>getservbyname</B>() lookup of ``ftpgate/tcp''.

     HOME	       For default location of a <I>.netrc</I> file, if one exists.

     PAGER	       Used by <B>page</B> to display files.

     SHELL	       For default shell.

     ftp_proxy	       URL of FTP proxy to use when making FTP URL requests
		       (if not defined, use the standard ftp protocol).

     http_proxy        URL of HTTP proxy to use when making HTTP URL requests.

<H2>HISTORY</H2><PRE>
     The <B>ftp</B> command appeared in 4.2BSD.

     Various features such as command line editing, context sensitive command
     and file completion, dynamic progress bar, automatic fetching of files,
     ftp and http URLs, and modification time preservation were implemented in
     NetBSD 1.3 by Luke Mewburn, with assistance from Jason Thorpe.


</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
     Correct execution of many commands depends upon proper behavior by the
     remote server.

     An error in the treatment of carriage returns in the 4.2BSD ascii-mode
     transfer code has been corrected.	This correction may result in incor-
     rect transfers of binary files to and from 4.2BSD servers using the ascii
     type.  Avoid this problem by using the binary image type.
