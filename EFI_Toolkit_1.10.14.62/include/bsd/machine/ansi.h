 * The rune type is declared to be an ``int'' instead of the more natural

 * it looks like 10646 will be a 31 bit standard.  This means that if your
 * ints cannot hold 32 bits, you will be in trouble.  The reason an int was
 * chosen over a long is that the is*() and to*() routines take ints (says
 * ANSI C), but they use _BSD_CT_RUNE_T_ instead of int.  By changing it
 * here, you lose a bit of ANSI conformance, but your programs will still
