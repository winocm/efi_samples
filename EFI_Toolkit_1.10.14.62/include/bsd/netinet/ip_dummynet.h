/*
 * Definition of dummynet data structures.
 * Dummynet handles a list of pipes, each one identified by a unique
 * number (hopefully the list is short so we use a linked list).
 *
 * Each list contains a set of parameters identifying the pipe, and
 * a set of packets queued on the pipe itself.
 *
 * I could have used queue macros, but the management i have
 * is pretty simple and this makes the code more portable.

 * ip_output(), the struct is prepended to the mbuf chain with type
 * MT_DUMMYNET, and contains the pointer to the matching rule.
