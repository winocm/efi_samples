Usage:

1: Update Unicode text file "helpdata.src" using following format.

<!>cmd1name
<1>cmd1syntax
<2>cmd1linehelp
<3>cmd1verboseHelp

<!>cmd2name
<1>cmd2syntax
<2>cmd2linehelp
<3>cmd2verboseHelp
...

2: Run (double-click) GenHelp.exe to generate "helpdata.c".


Notes:
1. Helpdata.src is a Unicode text file.
2. All the help information including syntax, line help info, verbose help info shall be added into helpdata.src.
3. When user want to add/update help info for one command, he/she only need to update helpdata.src, and run GenHelp.exe to generate new helpdata.c. They should not directly add help info in source file of the command.
4. Helpdata.c should be always placed in shell\helpdata directory.
5. The tag <!>, <1>,<2> and <3> for one command should always be there. If one command does not contain verbose help info, user still need to type '<3>' and leave blank after that.
6. Only when a Cmd has both CmdName and CmdLineHelp in HelpData.src, it can be listed with 'help'.
